      <description>Imagine dealing with a flood of complaints every day without a clear system to organize, track, or resolve them. That was the challenge for Kemenkumham RI (Ministry of Law and Human Rights, Indonesia). Complaints were piling up in scattered systems, manual processes slowed things down, and stakeholders had no clue about the status of their issues.
That’s where SIMONA BIDUAN (short for Sistem Monitoring Pelayanan Bidang Informasi dan Pengaduan Stakeholders) comes in—a web application I had the opportunity to create from scratch between September and November 2023.</description>

What’s COVID-19 WebGIS? It&amp;rsquo;s a web-based application that provides a visual representation of COVID-19 data in Indonesia. Users can view real-time stats, including case numbers, recoveries, and deaths, all displayed on interactive maps and easy-to-read charts.</description>
