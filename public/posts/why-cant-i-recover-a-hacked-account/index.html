Is it because our skills aren’t as good as these hackers?\nLet’s talk about it…\nBefore answering the question, “Why can’t we recover hacked accounts?”, we need to understand a few things first:\nHow hackers steal accounts Phishing mindset Cyber Attack Knowledge Pyramid Possible Solutions How Do Hackers Steal Accounts? Some of you might still think that hackers steal accounts by sitting in front of a black screen with green text, typing in complex codes to break into your social media accounts. Sounds familiar, right? 😅\nIs that what hackers actually do?\nWell, yes, a hacker might be doing that… but is that how a thief steals your account? NO!\nMost of the time, hackers don’t use complex codes or “super abilities” to break into an app like Instagram. Instead, they use something called PHISHING.\nTo make it simple:\nPHISHING = TRICKING YOU\nExample: You get a DM from someone pretending to be Instagram, telling you that your account has been selected for verification (blue checkmark). Then they ask you to click a link that seems like it’s for confirmation.\nExcited, you click the link and see a fake login page that looks just like Instagram’s. Without thinking, you enter your username and password… and boom, your account is hacked. 🙃\nThere are a ton of ways hackers send phishing links and manipulate your psychology to trick you.\nPhishing Mindset It’s important to remember:\nPhishing doesn’t attack the app\nInstead, it attacks your mind.\nWhen your Instagram account gets hacked, it’s NOT because the hacker broke into Instagram or your account specifically. They just tricked you into entering your login details yourself.\nWhy is it important to understand this mindset?\nBecause it helps you realize that you can’t just blame Instagram for security.\n“Ah, it’s okay if I click on any link. Instagram will protect me.”\nThat’s wrong. Your account’s security is your responsibility. Instagram can’t help if you willingly hand over your username and password.\nSo, we’ve covered 2 points so far:\nThe hacker steals your account by tricking you (phishing). Phishing targets your psychology, not the app itself. Next, let’s look at the Cyber Attack Knowledge Pyramid.\nCyber Attack Knowledge Pyramid If we look at the pyramid of knowledge, hackers are at the “KNOWLEDGEABLE” level, while the victims of phishing attacks are at the “CLUELESS” level.\nIt makes sense that hackers target the clueless because they have a much higher chance of success.\nNow, here’s the problem: We know that hackers steal accounts by tricking people, but when my friends and I, as cybersecurity professionals, are asked to help recover a hacked account, we need to trick the hacker back.\nIs that possible?\nMaybe, but it’s incredibly difficult. Why?\nBecause hackers know exactly how phishing works and use advanced techniques to deceive people. It’s like trying to hypnotize a hypnotist – it’s extremely hard.\nSo, now it’s clear why I and other cybersecurity professionals can’t help recover hacked accounts.\nBut can a hacked account be recovered? YES! But only under certain conditions:\nThe hacker hasn’t changed the victim’s email/phone number/etc. The victim still has access to their recovery email/phone number. The victim has 2FA enabled. And more… I, along with other cybersecurity experts, can’t help if your account has already been hacked. We can only educate you before it happens. Here’s some advice:\nENABLE 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication)! It’s a must! Don’t click random links from strangers. If you’re unsure, ask someone who knows better. Use strong, unique passwords for every account. Be careful with suspicious emails/DMs/SMS/WhatsApp messages. Check your account activity regularly. Educate yourself about cybersecurity. And more… “But what about those hacking services or account recovery services?”\nThink about it: If they could hack accounts easily, why not just hack all the celebrity/president/important accounts directly? 😅 They wouldn’t need to offer a service, right?\nIf someone claims to recover an account that’s been hacked (where the email and other details are already changed), there are two possibilities:\nThey’re tricking you. They might actually be the hacker. 🙃 These “services” usually ask for a deposit or payment upfront before giving you the username and password.\nIf you’re curious, you can try it yourself, but don’t say I didn’t warn you. 😆\n“But celebrities get their accounts recovered even after they’re hacked.”\nTrue, they have special access and privileges with social media platforms and law enforcement. You can report to the authorities or Instagram directly if you’d like. 😃\nI hope after reading this, you understand the process better and can protect yourself from phishing attacks. Stay alert, and don’t fall for these tricks.\nThanks for reading – stay safe out there! ✌\nReferences: https://medium.com/@ronafebriana/kenapa-saya-tidak-bisa-mengembalikan-akun-yang-terkena-hack-c07b34963bb8\n","wordCount":"795","inLanguage":"en","image":"http://localhost:1313/%3Cimage%20path/url%3E","datePublished":"2025-01-31T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2025-01-31T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Tomi Mulhartono"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-cant-i-recover-a-hacked-account/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Tomi Mulhartono","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http://localhost:1313/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=http://localhost:1313/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=http://localhost:1313/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/search/ title="Search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>Search</span></a></li><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=http://localhost:1313/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=http://localhost:1313/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Why Can't I Recover an Account That's Been Hacked?</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2025-01-31 00:00:00 +0000 +0000'>January 31, 2025</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;Tomi Mulhartono</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#how-do-hackers-steal-accounts>How Do Hackers Steal Accounts?</a></li><li><a href=#phishing-mindset>Phishing Mindset</a></li><li><a href=#cyber-attack-knowledge-pyramid>Cyber Attack Knowledge Pyramid</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><p>Have you ever wondered why I, along with my friends (who are experts in cybersecurity), can&rsquo;t recover hacked accounts?
