This program was designed to transform individuals with no prior experience into skilled penetration testers and bug hunters. And let me tell you, it was an incredible journey.\nWhat I Learned The bootcamp covered a wide range of topics, including:\nNetworking fundamentals: This gave me a solid understanding of how networks work, which is essential for identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities. Web application security: I learned how to find and exploit common web application vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting. Penetration testing: I gained hands-on experience with a variety of penetration testing tools and techniques. Bug hunting: I learned how to find and report security vulnerabilities in popular software programs. The Bootcamp Experience The bootcamp was led by experienced industry professionals who were passionate about sharing their knowledge. The learning environment was highly collaborative, and I had the opportunity to work on projects with other talented students.\nOne of the highlights of the bootcamp was the capstone project. In this project, we were tasked with finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in a real-world web application. This was a challenging but rewarding experience that gave us a chance to apply the skills we had learned throughout the program.\nMy Key Takeaways Here are a few key takeaways from my bootcamp experience:\nCyber security is a fascinating and ever-evolving field. There’s always something new to learn, which keeps things exciting. There’s a huge demand for skilled cyber security professionals. If you’re interested in this field, there are plenty of opportunities available. A bootcamp is a great way to learn the skills you need to launch a career in cyber security. It’s an intensive and immersive experience that will give you the knowledge and skills you need to succeed. Mastering OWASP Web Security Testing Guide and More During my intensive Cyber Security Bootcamp journey at SanberCode, I not only gained expertise in penetration testing and bug hunting but also delved into advanced topics such as OWASP Web Security Testing Guide, the CIA Triad, Git vulnerability, Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR), SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Android Application Penetration Testing. With hands-on experience using tools like Burp Suite, I’m now equipped to tackle complex security challenges and contribute effectively to the cybersecurity landscape.\nMy Next Steps I’m excited to continue learning and growing in the cyber security field. I’m currently looking for a job as a penetration tester or bug hunter, and I’m confident that I have the skills and experience to be successful.\nI’m also planning to start my own blog to share what I’ve learned with others. I hope to inspire others to pursue a career in cyber security and help make the world a safer place.\nCertificates Name Issuer Credential ID Certificate Cyber Security : Become a Pentester and Bug Hunter SanberCode 41656/570/SNBR/BOOTCAMP/II/2024 I would like to thank SanberCode for providing me with the opportunity to participate in this amazing bootcamp.
