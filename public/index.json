Today, I’ll guide you step-by-step through deploying T-Pot on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). By the end, you’ll have a fully operational T-Pot honeypot ready to capture and visualize attack data.\nWhat is T-Pot? T-Pot, developed by T-Mobile, is an all-in-one honeypot platform supporting over 20 honeypots. It includes features like animated attack maps, visualization through Elastic Stack, and a suite of tools for enhanced threat analysis. This setup will run on GCP using a Debian-based virtual machine (VM).\n⚠ Note: T-Pot is resource-intensive. Make sure to use a suitable machine type (like e2-standard-4) and SSD storage. Running the VM will incur charges, but the costs are manageable if used sparingly for experiments or labs.\nLet’s Get Started! Step 1: Launch a GCP VM Go to GCP Console: Navigate to the GCP Console. Create a New VM Instance: Go to Compute Engine \u0026gt; VM Instances and click Create Instance. Set the instance name to tpot-honeypot. Choose a Region \u0026amp; Zone: Pick a region and zone close to your location or preference. Machine Type: Select e2-standard-4 (4 vCPUs, 16 GB RAM). Boot Disk: OS: Debian GNU/Linux 12 (Bookworm). Disk Type: SSD Persistent Disk. Size: 50GB. Step 2: Configure Firewall Rules We need two firewall rules for T-Pot:\nManagement Ports: Restrict access to T-Pot management ports. Lure Ports: Open a wide range of ports to attract potential attackers. Create Firewall Rule for Management Ports:\nName: tpot-ingress.\nTargets: Specific VMs with the tag tpot-ingress.\nIP Ranges: Private IP range of your VM (you can get this from the VM details).\nProtocols and Ports: Allow TCP on ports 64294, 64295, and 64297.\nCreate Firewall Rule for Lure Ports:\nName: tpot-ports.\nTargets: Specific VMs with the tag tpot-ports.\nIP Ranges: 0.0.0.0/0.\nProtocols and Ports: Allow all protocols and ports.\nAttach Tags to VM:\nGo to your VM instance details.\nAdd tpot-ingress and tpot-ports tags under Network Tags.\nStep 3: Connect to Your VM SSH into the VM:\nOpen the SSH terminal for tpot-honeypot directly from the GCP console.\nUpdate and install necessary packages:\ntomi_mulhartono@tpot-honeypot:~$ sudo apt-get update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo apt-get upgrade Download and Install T-Pot:\nClone the T-Pot GitHub repository: tomi_mulhartono@tpot-honeypot:~$ git clone https://github.com/telekom-security/tpotce\nNavigate to the installer directory: tomi_mulhartono@tpot-honeypot:~$ cd tpotce\nRun the installation script: tomi_mulhartono@tpot-honeypot:~$ ./install.sh\nComplete Installation:\nChoose T-Pot Standard / HIVE installation. Set a username and password for the Web Admin UI. Confirm and let the script install the necessary components. This might take some time. Once installation is complete, your SSH connection will reset because T-Pot disables port 22. Post-Installation Steps\nReconnect via Port 64295:\nUse SSH to Connect to the VM through GCP Console (Custom Port): Verify T-Pot Services:\nRun the following command to ensure all services are active: tomi_mulhartono@tpot-honeypot:~$ dpsw\nLook for the Up status for all honeypot services.\nAccess the Web UI:\nOpen your browser and navigate to https://[VM_External_IP]:64297.\nLog in using the credentials you set during installation.\nExplore T-Pot’s dashboard, attack maps, and data visualizations.\nExplore the Data After a few hours, you\u0026rsquo;ll start seeing real attack data. Highlights include:\nAttack Maps: Visualize attacks in real-time. Logs: Review honeypot-specific logs for SSH, Telnet, and other protocols. Threat Analysis: Investigate vulnerability exploits like CVE-2023-46604 and more. Conclusion Deploying T-Pot on GCP is a rewarding exercise for anyone interested in cybersecurity. You now have a fully functional honeypot collecting and visualizing attack data. Experiment with different configurations, analyze the results, and gain valuable insights into attack patterns.\nRemember, always monitor your GCP billing to avoid unexpected charges. Enjoy exploring the fascinating world of honeypots with T-Pot!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/deploying-tpot-honeypot-on-gcp/","summary":"If you\u0026rsquo;re looking to explore security and dive into honeypot analysis, T-Pot is a fantastic tool that consolidates multiple honeypots into one robust platform.

If you’re gearing up to launch a new application on OpenResty Edge, you’re in the right place. Whether you’re a seasoned pro or just starting out, I’ll walk you through every step of the way with a dash of fun. Grab your favorite drink, settle in, and let’s dive into this setup adventure!\nCreating Your New Application Let\u0026rsquo;s get that new app live and kicking in no time. Here\u0026rsquo;s how to create your first application on OpenResty Edge.\nLogin to your OpenResty Edge dashboard\nHead over to the OpenResty Edge dashboard, and log in using your credentials.\nNavigate to the Applications section\nOnce you\u0026rsquo;re logged in, take a look at the top menu bar and click on Applications. This is where the magic begins! Once you\u0026rsquo;re in the applications section, click on the Create New App button to start the process of building your app.\nFill Out the application details\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll need to provide some information to configure your app. Here’s a quick breakdown of each field you’ll encounter:\nFields What to Enter Domains Enter your domain name here (e.g., tomi-example.co.id). HTTP Port You can leave this blank for now. HTTPS Port Set to 443 for secure traffic. Label Give your app a memorable label, like Create a New Example App. Once you’ve filled everything out, hit Save! Your application is officially created, and you\u0026rsquo;re one step closer to deploying it live.\nConfiguring Page Rules Next up, let\u0026rsquo;s make sure everything runs smoothly by configuring Page Rules. This allows you to set conditions and actions for traffic coming to your application.\nCustom Edge Language Rules at the Beginning of This Page Before diving into predefined rules, let’s look at how you can add custom rules using OpenResty\u0026rsquo;s Edge Language. For example, if you want to block requests from specific IPs and log alerts, you can use the following:\nclient-addr !~~ any (192.168.100.1) =\u0026gt; errlog(level: \u0026#34;alert\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;SEC-00- Unauthorized IP!\u0026#34;, foreign-call(module: \u0026#34;headers-log\u0026#34;, func: \u0026#34;go\u0026#34;) ~ req-body()), exit(444); This rule does two things:\nBlocks traffic from the IP 192.168.100.1. Logs an alert with the message \u0026ldquo;Unauthorized IP!\u0026rdquo;. Feel free to tweak these rules to fit your specific needs. After adding them, hit Save to apply.\nCreate New Rules Let’s move on to setting up some common rules you\u0026rsquo;ll probably need, starting with redirecting traffic from HTTP to HTTPS.\nRedirect HTTP to HTTPS Redirecting users from HTTP to HTTPS is a great way to improve both security and user experience. Here’s how you can set that up:\nClick on New Rule in the Page Rules section.\nSet the condition to identify when the rule should trigger:\nIn the When section, click Add a new condition.\nFrom the Variable dropdown, choose Scheme.\nIn the Operator dropdown, select String =.\nIn the Value dropdown, select http.\nAdd the Action to redirect traffic:\nUnder the Actions section, click Add a new action. From the Action Types dropdown, choose Redirect. Set the following fields: URI: Choose current.\nURI arguments: Choose current.\nScheme: Set this to https.\nHost: Choose current.\nPort: Set this to blank value.\nStatus Code: Choose 302 Moved Temporarily.\nThis will ensure all users trying to access your site via HTTP will be securely redirected to HTTPS.\nSet Proxy Header If your application relies on specific headers to proxy traffic correctly, you’ll want to configure that as well. Let’s set up a rule to ensure the correct host header is passed along:\nClick on New Rule in the Page Rules section.\nSet the condition for when this rule should apply:\nIn the When section, click Add a new condition.\nFrom the Variable dropdown, choose Host.\nIn the Value field, choose String, then type your domain, e.g., tomi-example.co.id.\nSet the first action to modify the Host header:\nUnder the Actions section, click Add a new action. From the Action Types dropdown, choose Set proxy header. Set the following fields: Header: Enter Host. Value: Choose String and enter your domain, e.g., tomi-example.co.id. Add a second action to append the X-Forwarded-For header:\nUnder the Actions section, click Add a new action again. From the Action Types dropdown, choose Append proxy header value. Set the following fields: Header: Choose X-Forwarded-For.\nValue: Choose Built-in Variable and select Client address.\nConfigure the Proxy settings:\nScroll down to the Proxy section to On.\nSelect the appropriate Proxy to upstream from the dropdown, e.g., example-backend.\nFor Balancing Policy, choose Round Robin\nThis ensures the correct headers are sent to the backend and helps maintain a smooth user experience.\nAdd Custom Edge Language Rules at the End of This Page To improve site performance, caching static assets like JavaScript and CSS is a great practice. Here’s how you can set up cache rules:\nuri-suffix( rx:s/\\.(?:js|css|xml).{0,3}$/), req-method(\u0026#34;GET\u0026#34;)=\u0026gt; enable-proxy-cache(key: uri), enforce-proxy-cache(7 [day]), set-resp-header(\u0026#34;Cache-Control\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;public, max-age=604800, immutable\u0026#34;); uri-suffix( rx:s/\\.(?:gif|png|js|css|html|jpg|wof|svg|woff2|ttf|otf|eot|ico).{0,5}$/), req-method(\u0026#34;GET\u0026#34;)=\u0026gt; enable-proxy-cache(key: uri), enforce-proxy-cache(365 [day]), set-resp-header(\u0026#34;Cache-Control\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;public, max-age=3153600, immutable\u0026#34;); This speeds up load times by storing frequently requested assets for a longer period.\nConfiguring Upstreams Now, let’s make sure your app knows where to send requests by configuring an upstream server (where your app\u0026rsquo;s backend lives).\nClick on Upstreams from your dashboard menu.\nAdd a New Upstream and fill out the details:\nFields What to Enter Upstream Name Enter a name for your upstream, like example-backend. Protocol Choose HTTPS. Host Enter the domain or IP address of your backend server (e.g., tomi-backend.int). Port Set this to 443. Weight Set it to 1. Enabled Switch this On. After everything is set, click Save!\nConfiguring SSL Setting up SSL is key to securing your users\u0026rsquo; data. You\u0026rsquo;ll need to work with your DevOps team to get your SSL certificates in place, but here\u0026rsquo;s how you can set things up in the OpenResty Edge dashboard.\nManage SSL Certificates In the SSL menu, you\u0026rsquo;ll see a table to manage certificates. Here’s what you’ll typically need:\nYour SSL certificate (provided by a Certificate Authority). The private key associated with the certificate. Your domain, pointing to the correct gateway cluster. Make sure all of these details are in order before proceeding.\nCheck Gateway Clusters Lastly, double-check the Gateway Clusters tab. Ensure the IP addresses listed here match the setup for your domain to avoid any connection issues.\nYou\u0026rsquo;re almost done! Once you\u0026rsquo;re satisfied with all the configurations, click the Release button. This will push your changes live, and your app will officially be up and running!\nAnd there you have it! Your new application is now up and running, with all the necessary rules and configurations in place. If you have any questions or run into any issues, don’t hesitate to reach out. Here’s to smooth sailing and successful deployments!\nFeel free to revisit this guide anytime you need a refresher or have new tweaks to make. Happy configuring!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/creating-a-new-app-on-openresty-edge/","summary":"Welcome aboard!

Great choice! Setting up Grafana alerts and integrating them with Slack and Jira through n8n is a powerful way to keep your team on the ball. Let’s dive in and get those workflows automated!\nSetting Up Grafana Alerts First up, let’s get your Grafana alerts configured so you’re always in the know. Here’s the lowdown on how to get your alerts up and running:\nPick Your Data Source\nStart by selecting where your data is coming from. Grafana’s got your back with a bunch of data source options.\nQuery Your Data\nDive into the data you want to keep an eye on. Use queries to drill down to the metrics or logs you care about.\nNormalize Your Data\nGet your data in shape! Make sure it’s consistent and ready for analysis.\nSet Your Threshold\nDefine what makes your alert go off. What’s the magic number or condition that means it’s time to pay attention?\nCreate Queries, Expressions, and Conditions\nCraft the queries and set the conditions that will trigger your alert.\nNote: Expressions are a Grafana-managed feature, so they’re only available if you’re using Grafana\u0026rsquo;s own alerting.\nHow Should Your Alerts Be Evaluated?\nDecide how often you want Grafana to check if your alert conditions are met. More frequent checks mean quicker notifications, but it might also mean more noise.\nLabels and Notifications\nThink about how you want to route your alerts. Adding labels can help you categorize and find your alerts more easily.\nAnnotations\nWant to add a little extra detail? Annotations let you include context in your notifications—like what caused the alert and which server it came from.\nReady to get started? With these steps, you’ll be on top of your data in no time!\nConfigure Grafana-managed alert rules Grafana-managed alerts are super flexible and let you pull data from any of our supported data sources. You can even combine data from different sources in one alert rule and use expressions to tweak your data and set up your alert conditions. Plus, you can include images in your notifications. Here’s how you can create and manage these alerts:\nStep 1: Set Alert Rule Name Click on Alerts \u0026amp; IRM -\u0026gt; Alert rules -\u0026gt; + New alert rule.\nEnter a name for your alert rule.\nThis name helps you identify it in your list and shows up as the alertname label for all alerts created from this rule.\nStep 2: Define Query and Condition Set up a query to fetch the data you want and define a condition that must be met before the alert triggers.\nPick a data source.\nChoose a time range from the Options dropdown.\nNote: Grafana Alerting supports fixed relative time ranges like now-24hr: now, but not absolute time ranges (e.g., 2021-12-02 00:00:00 to 2021-12-05 23:59:59) or semi-relative time ranges (e.g., now/d to: now).\nAdd a query.\nTo add more queries, click Add query.\nAll alert rules are managed by Grafana by default. If you prefer data source-managed alert rules, click Switch to data source-managed alert rule.\nAdd one or more expressions.\na. Choose either Classic condition for a single alert rule or select Math, Reduce, and Resample options for separate alerts per series.\nb. Click Preview to check if the expression is working.\nTo add a recovery threshold, turn on the Custom recovery threshold toggle and enter a value for when your alert rule should stop firing.\nYou can only add one recovery threshold in a query, and it must be the alert condition.\nClick Set as alert condition on the query or expression you want to use as your alert condition.\nStep 3: Set Alert Evaluation Behavior Determine how often the alert rule should be evaluated and how quickly it should change its state.\nChoose a folder or click + New folder.\nSelect an evaluation group or click + New evaluation group.\nIf you’re creating a new evaluation group, set the interval for the group.\nAll rules within the same group are evaluated together over the same time interval.\nSet a pending period.\nThe pending period is how long an alert rule can be in breach of the condition before it triggers.\nOnce the condition is met, the alert goes into the Pending state. If it stays active for the entire pending period, it changes to the Firing state; otherwise, it goes back to the Normal state.\nTurn on pause alert notifications if needed.\nNote: You can pause alert rule evaluation to avoid noisy alerts while you’re tuning them. Pausing stops evaluation and doesn’t create alert instances. This is different from mute timings, which stop notifications but still allow evaluation and creation of alert instances.\nIn Configure no data and error handling, set how you want the alert to behave when there’s no data.\nStep 4: Configure Labels and Notifications Add labels to organize your alert rules and set up notification policies for your alerts.\nAdd labels if needed.\nYou can select existing key-value pairs from a dropdown or enter new ones.\nChoose how notifications are sent when an alert fires by either selecting a contact point or using a notification policy.\nSelect contact point\na. Pick this option to select an existing contact point. All notifications for this alert rule will go to this contact point automatically, bypassing notification policies.\nb. Optionally, select a mute timing and groupings to define when notifications shouldn’t be sent.\nNote: An auto-generated notification policy is created. Only admins can view these auto-generated policies in the Notification policies list view. Any changes need to be made in the alert rules form.\nUse notification policy\na. Choose this to use the notification policy tree for routing notifications.\nNote: All alert rules and instances follow the default notification policy. If there are no nested policies or if no nested policies match the labels in the alert rule or instance, the default policy is used.\nb. Preview your alert instance routing setup.\nBased on the labels added, alert instances will be routed according to the notification policies shown.\nc. Expand each notification policy below to view more details.\nd. Click See details to check alert routing details and an email preview.\nStep 5: Add Annotations Add annotations to provide extra context in your alert notification messages.\nAnnotations add metadata to give more information about the alert. For instance, a Summary annotation can explain which value caused the alert or which server it happened on.\nOptional: Add a summary. A brief explanation of what happened and why. Optional: Add a description. Detail what the alert rule does. Optional: Add a Runbook URL. A webpage link to your runbook for the alert. Optional: Add a custom annotation. Optional: Add a dashboard and panel link. Link alerts to specific panels in a dashboard. Note: Currently, alerts are supported only in time series and alert list visualizations.\nClick Save rule. Configure Contact Points Use contact points to pick how you want to get notified when your alert rules go off. You can add, edit, delete, export, and test a contact point.\nStep 1: Add a Contact Point Here’s how to add a contact point:\nIn the left-side menu, click on Alerts \u0026amp; IRM and then Alerting. Click on Contact Points.\nFrom the Choose Alertmanager dropdown, pick an Alertmanager. Grafana Alertmanager is the default option.\nOn the Contact Points tab, click + Add Contact Point.\nEnter a name for your contact point.\nFrom Integration, select the type and fill in the required fields. For example, if you choose email, enter the email addresses. Or if you choose Slack, enter the Slack channel and the users you want to contact.\nSome integrations, like email or Webhook, have optional settings. In Optional Settings, you can add extra settings for the integration.\nIn Notification Settings, you can choose to Disable Resolved Message if you don’t want to be notified when an alert is resolved.\nIf you want to add another contact point integration, click Add Contact Point Integration and repeat steps 6 through 8.\nSave your changes.\nStep 2: Test a Contact Point Here’s how to test a contact point:\nIn the left-side menu, click on Alerts \u0026amp; IRM and then Alerting. Click on Contact Points to see your list of contact points. Find the contact point you want to test, then click Edit. You can also create a new contact point if needed. Click Test to open the testing dialog box. Choose whether to send a predefined test notification or go custom by adding your own annotations and labels. Click Send Test Notification to trigger the alert. Configure Notification Policies Notification policies help you decide how alerts are sent to your contact points. They work in a tree-like structure where each policy can have one or more nested policies. Except for the default policy, each one can match specific alert labels.\nStep 1: Add a Nested Policy You can create a nested policy under the default one or under any existing nested policy. Here’s how you do it:\nGo to the left-side menu and click Alerts \u0026amp; IRM, then Alerting. Click Notification policies.\nClick +New nested policy from the default policy.\nIn the Matching labels section, add one or more rules to match alert labels.\nFrom the Contact point dropdown, choose the contact point to send notifications to if an alert matches this specific policy and not any nested policies.\n[Optional] If you want alerts to keep matching sibling policies after finding a match, enable Continue matching subsequent sibling nodes. This option can result in multiple notifications for the same alert.\n[Optional] To use the same grouping settings as the default policy, enable Override grouping. If this isn’t enabled, it’ll use the default policy’s grouping settings.\n[Optional] To override the timing options set in the group notification policy, enable Override general timings.\nClick Save policy to apply your changes.\nBuild Your n8n Create custom workflows between Grafana, Slack, and Jira by picking triggers and actions. Each node comes with general settings, plus app-specific options you can tweak. You can also use the HTTP Request node to pull data from any app or service with a REST API. Ready to bring it all together? Here’s how you can set up a workflow:\nHow to Connect Grafana, Slack, and Jira Step 1: Set up n8n First, make sure n8n is installed and running:\nInstall n8n on any platform using npm or Docker. Or, let n8n handle it for you with its cloud hosting. Step 2: Create a New Workflow to Connect Grafana, Slack, and Jira Open n8n, go to the Workflows tab, and click Add workflow to start a new one.\nStep 3: Add the First Step Decide what will kick off your workflow: a schedule, a webhook call, another workflow, or manually. Sometimes Grafana, Slack, or Jira can be your starting point. Just click Open nodes panel, search for Grafana, Slack, or Jira, or choose a trigger. For this case, drag the webhook node onto the canvas—it\u0026rsquo;ll serve as the contact point. Just like before, copy and paste the URL there.\nStep 4: Add the Slack Node Drag the Slack node onto the canvas. Choose what you want Slack to do before dragging.\nStep 5: Authenticate Slack Click on the Slack node, then select Select credential next to the Credential to connect with field. Follow the prompts to link n8n to your Slack account.\nStep 6: Add the Jira Node Drag the Jira node from the nodes panel to the workflow canvas. Choose the action you want Jira to perform before dragging, such as creating an issue or updating a task.\nStep 7: Authenticate Jira Click on the Jira node, then click the Select credential dropdown option next to the Credential to connect with field. Follow the instructions to connect n8n to your Jira account. Make sure you have the right permissions in Jira to perform the desired actions.\nStep 8: Configure Slack and Jira Nodes Click on each node to adjust settings. On the left, you’ll see the input data. In the middle, set up parameters like resources and operations. The output will appear on the right.\nStep 9: Connect Webhook, Slack, and Jira Link the nodes together in the order you need. For example, you can connect Grafana’s Webhook output to Slack, then link Slack’s output to Jira, or rearrange them to fit your workflow.\nStep 10: Customize Your Webhook, Slack, and Jira Integration Use n8n’s core nodes to shape the data and extend your setup:\nSplitting: IF, Switch Merging: Merge, Compare Datasets Looping: IF, Loop Over Items Waiting: Wait Sub-workflows: Execute Workflow, Execute Workflow Trigger Error Handling: Stop And Error, Error Trigger Code: Write custom JavaScript or Python code and run it within your workflow. Step 11: Save and Activate Workflow After configuring Webhook (Grafana), Slack, Jira, and any extra nodes, save your workflow and activate it. Once active, the workflow will automatically run whenever a trigger node gets input or meets a condition. New workflows start deactivated by default.\nStep 12: Test the Workflow Run the workflow to see if everything’s working between Webhook (Grafana), Slack, and Jira. Depending on your setup, data should move smoothly between them. If something goes wrong, you can debug by checking past runs to spot and fix mistakes.\nWrap-Up Setting up Grafana alerts and integrating with tools like Slack and Jira boosts your monitoring and incident management by automating notifications and streamlining responses to critical issues. With your alerts, contact points, and notification policies in place, your setup is ready to keep you informed and proactive. Experiment with conditions, refine alerts, and customize integrations to fit your needs. This powerful combo helps you stay on top of your data, tackle issues before they escalate, and keep everything running smoothly.\nHappy monitoring, and may your alerts always be insightful!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/integrating-grafana-slack-and-jira/","summary":"So, you’re ready to up your game and make sure you never miss a critical update?

This virtual machine is designed specifically for beginners like me, offering a controlled space to learn the ropes of exploiting vulnerabilities and gaining access.\nIn this guide, I\u0026rsquo;ll walk you through the thrilling journey of taking down Basic Pentesting 1, step-by-step. So, grab your tools and get ready to unleash your inner hacker (for good, of course)!\nFinding the Target: Local and Target IP Addresses Before I launch my attack, I need to pinpoint the target machine\u0026rsquo;s location on the network. This is akin to finding a pirate ship on the high seas (except way less swashbuckling).\nStep 1: Find Your Local IP Address First things first, I\u0026rsquo;ll identify my local IP address. This serves as my starting point for finding the target\u0026rsquo;s IP. I can usually find this in my network settings.\nkali@kali:~$ ifconfig Local IP Address: 192.168.100.9\nStep 2: Scan for Active Devices Next, I\u0026rsquo;ll use a tool called netdiscover to scan for active devices on the network.

High fives all around!\nScanning for Open Ports With my target in sight, it\u0026rsquo;s time to gather some intel. I\u0026rsquo;ll use a powerful tool called nmap to scan the target machine and identify any open ports. These ports act like doorways into the system, and I\u0026rsquo;ll be looking for any that might be vulnerable.\nkali@kali:~$ nmap -p- -A 192.168.100.8 The scan might reveal something like this:\nPort Service Version 21 FTP ProFTPD 1.3.3c 22 SSH OpenSSH 7.2p2 Ubuntu 80 HTTP Apache httpd 2.4.18 This information is like a treasure map, guiding me towards potential weaknesses!\nExploring the Web Server (Port 80) My scan revealed an open port 80, which usually indicates a web server.

This is a small hurdle, but I can fix it!\nFixing Domain Issues with the Hosts File To make those links work properly, I need to create a little map. I\u0026rsquo;ll edit a file called \u0026ldquo;hosts\u0026rdquo; on my machine, which tells my computer how to translate domain names into IP addresses.\nStep 1: Edit the Hosts File kali@kali:~$ sudo nano /etc/hosts Step 2: Add a line for the domain name In this file, I\u0026rsquo;ll add a new line that associates the domain name \u0026ldquo;vtcsec\u0026rdquo; with the target machine\u0026rsquo;s IP address.\nNow, when I try those links again, they should work like a charm!\nCracking the WordPress Login Panel After fixing the domain issue, the \u0026ldquo;secret\u0026rdquo; page finally displays properly. But here\u0026rsquo;s the twist: it leads me to a familiar sight – a WordPress login panel!\nThis is a golden opportunity! WordPress can sometimes be vulnerable, and I can use a tool called WPScan to exploit those vulnerabilities.\nStep 1: Use WPScan With WPScan in hand, I\u0026rsquo;ll conduct user enumeration to uncover potential usernames on the WordPress login panel. This step is crucial as it helps me identify accounts I can potentially exploit.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll fire up WPScan with the following command:\nkali@kali:~$ wpscan --url https://192.168.100.8/secret/ enumerate -u This command instructs WPScan to enumerate usernames on the specified URL. I\u0026rsquo;ll keep my eyes peeled for any usernames that might come up! Using WPScan, I might be able to find a username like \u0026ldquo;admin\u0026rdquo;.\nStep 2: Crack Passwords Now that I have some potential usernames, it\u0026rsquo;s time to crack some passwords! I\u0026rsquo;ll use WPScan again, this time with a wordlist to brute-force my way into the system.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the command I\u0026rsquo;ll use:\nkali@kali:~$ wpscan --url http://vtcsec/secret/ --username admin --passwords /path/to/wordlist.txt --force I\u0026rsquo;ll replace \u0026ldquo;/path/to/wordlist.txt\u0026rdquo; with the path to my chosen wordlist. WPScan will then attempt to crack the password for the \u0026ldquo;admin\u0026rdquo; user.\nSuccess! I\u0026rsquo;ve managed to breach the WordPress login panel using the credentials I uncovered. Now, I\u0026rsquo;m inside the system, ready to explore and exploit further.\nBut wait, there\u0026rsquo;s more!\nGaining Access: Upload a PHP Shell Now that I have access to the WordPress panel, it\u0026rsquo;s time to take things up a notch. I\u0026rsquo;ll inject a malicious PHP script to establish a reverse shell connection from the target machine to my attacker machine.\nStep 1: Prepare the PHP Shell I\u0026rsquo;ll use a popular PHP reverse shell script, such as the one found at GitHub.\nStep 2: Inject the Script I\u0026rsquo;ll head over to the Appearance section in the WordPress panel and select the Editor. From there, I\u0026rsquo;ll navigate to the Theme Header (header.php) file.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll delete any existing code in the file and replace it with the malicious PHP script code I obtained earlier. Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to update the IP address to your attacker machine\u0026rsquo;s IP and choose a port that isn\u0026rsquo;t in use.\nSave the changes, and now the trap is set!\nStep 3: Set Up Netcat Listener With the malicious PHP script in place, all that\u0026rsquo;s left to do is wait. I\u0026rsquo;ll fire up netcat on my attacker machine to listen for incoming connections:\nkali@kali:~$ nc -lvnp \u0026lt;chosen_port\u0026gt; Step 4: Trigger the PHP Shell Now, I\u0026rsquo;ll simply revisit the target URL where I injected the script, and voila! I\u0026rsquo;ll receive a connection on my netcat listener, confirming that I\u0026rsquo;ve successfully established a reverse shell connection.\nAnd there you have it – from reconnaissance to exploitation, I\u0026rsquo;ve conquered Vulnhub\u0026rsquo;s Basic Pentesting 1 like a true penetration testing pro!\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s Next? As I continue my cybersecurity journey, I\u0026rsquo;ll keep learning, exploring, and expanding my skillset. There\u0026rsquo;s always more to discover in this ever-evolving field.

During my technical interview at Protergo, I had the opportunity to showcase my skills by analyzing a suspicious file. In this blog post, I’ll walk you through the process I followed using Cuckoo Sandbox, a powerful tool for both static and dynamic analysis.\nWhat is Cuckoo Sandbox? Cuckoo Sandbox is an open-source automated malware analysis system that allows you to analyze malware in an isolated environment. It provides both static (without executing the code) and dynamic (while executing the code) analysis, making it a versatile tool for understanding the behavior of suspicious files.\nLet’s Get Started! Step 1: Unzip the Suspicious File Download the Sample File\nThe first step is to download the suspicious file that needs analysis. In this case, the file was a zip archive containing a PowerShell script.\nUnzip the File\nAfter downloading, I navigated to the location of the file and unzipped it to examine its contents. This step gives us the first look at the files inside the archive, helping to understand what we’re dealing with.\ncuckoo@cuckoo-sandbox:~$ cd Documents cuckoo@cuckoo-sandbox:~$ unzip PowerShellScript.zip Step 2: Set Up a Safe Environment Launch VirtualBox\nTo avoid any risk to my actual system, I fired up a separate virtual machine (VM) running Windows. This VM acts as an isolated environment, ensuring that the malware doesn\u0026rsquo;t spread or cause harm to the host machine.\ncuckoo@cuckoo-sandbox:~$ sudo virtualbox Prepare the Windows VM\nWithin VirtualBox, I set up the Windows environment with all necessary settings to simulate a real-world system where the malware can execute safely.\nStep 3: Start Cuckoo Sandbox Run Cuckoo in Daemon Mode\nAfter setting up the VM, I launched Cuckoo Sandbox in daemon mode. This mode allows Cuckoo to monitor and analyze the malware automatically once it\u0026rsquo;s executed in the virtual environment.\ncuckoo@cuckoo-sandbox:~$ sudo cuckoo -d Launch the Web Interface\nTo make the analysis more convenient, I ran Cuckoo’s web interface. This gives me a dashboard to track the malware’s behavior and access the analysis report via a browser, similar to browsing any website.\ncuckoo@cuckoo-sandbox:~$ sudo cuckoo web runserver Step 4: Import the Suspicious File for Analysis Upload the File to Cuckoo\nWith Cuckoo Sandbox up and running, I imported the suspicious PowerShell script into the system for detailed analysis. This allows Cuckoo to execute the file in the Windows VM while monitoring its activity.\nLet Cuckoo Execute the File\nOnce the file was uploaded, Cuckoo began executing it in the virtual machine. This step is where the dynamic analysis happens. The malware’s behavior was monitored closely in the isolated environment, simulating how it would act on an actual system.\nStep 5: Analyze the Report Review the Report\nAfter execution, Cuckoo Sandbox generated a detailed analysis report. This report included vital information such as:\nMalware Signatures: These are unique identifiers that help classify the type of malware.\nScreenshots: Cuckoo captured screenshots of the virtual machine’s activity during execution, providing visual evidence of the malware’s actions.\nExamine Static and Dynamic Analysis\nStatic Analysis: The static analysis, which examines the file without running it, didn’t reveal much. This is often the case with encrypted malware where the actual malicious code is hidden.\nStrings Analysis: The strings analysis, however, was more revealing. It showed strings related to keyloggers, suggesting that the malware was designed to monitor and steal user keystrokes (potentially passwords or sensitive information).\nBehavioral Analysis: Normally, this section details how the malware interacts with the system (e.g., file manipulation, registry changes, network communications). Unfortunately, in this case, the behavioral analysis section didn’t contain any data, which might indicate that the malware avoided triggering certain behaviors, or it wasn’t detected in this stage.\nLook for Indicators of Malicious Intent\nThe keylogger strings in the analysis were particularly concerning. Keyloggers are malicious programs designed to secretly record keystrokes, which can capture sensitive data like login credentials and passwords. This strongly suggested that the malware was designed to monitor and steal information from the user.\nStep 6: Conclude the Analysis Identify the Malware’s Intent\nBased on the findings from the report, it became clear that the malware was likely designed to function as a keylogger, capturing sensitive data from the user.\nExfiltration Potential\nThe report also suggested the possibility of exfiltrating the captured data, potentially sending it to an attacker’s email address. This highlights the danger of such malware, as it could lead to serious privacy breaches if left unchecked.\nConclusion Using Cuckoo Sandbox, I was able to analyze a suspicious file in a safe, controlled environment. The analysis revealed several key points: the malware\u0026rsquo;s primary function was likely to steal sensitive user data via a keylogger, and it could potentially exfiltrate that data to an attacker. This type of malware poses significant risks, especially if it\u0026rsquo;s able to capture login credentials and other sensitive information.\nStay safe and continue to explore the fascinating and ever-evolving world of malware analysis!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/malware-analysis-protergo/","summary":"If you’re interested in malware analysis, using Cuckoo Sandbox is an exciting and safe way to dissect potentially malicious files.
