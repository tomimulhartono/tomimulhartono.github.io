[{"content":"Welcome aboard! If you’re gearing up to launch a new application on OpenResty Edge, you’re in the right place. Whether you’re a seasoned pro or just starting out, I’ll walk you through every step of the way with a dash of fun. Grab your favorite drink, settle in, and let’s dive into this setup adventure!\nCreating Your New Application Let\u0026rsquo;s get that new app live and kicking in no time. Here\u0026rsquo;s how to create your first application on OpenResty Edge.\nLogin to Your OpenResty Edge Dashboard Head over to the OpenResty Edge dashboard, and log in using your credentials.\nNavigate to the Applications Section Once you\u0026rsquo;re logged in, take a look at the top menu bar and click on Applications. This is where the magic begins! Once you\u0026rsquo;re in the applications section, click on the Create New App button to start the process of building your app.\nFill in the Details You\u0026rsquo;ll need to provide some information to configure your app. Here’s a quick breakdown of each field you’ll encounter:\nFields What to Enter Domains Enter your domain name here (e.g., tomi-example.co.id). Partitions Select Default. Keep it simple for now. Default Application Leave this blank unless you have something specific in mind. HTTP Port You can leave this blank for now. HTTPS Port Set to 443 for secure traffic. HTTP2 Status (HTTPS) No need to select unless you want HTTP2 support. Label Give your app a memorable label, like Create a New Example App. Proxy to Upstream Leave this off for now; you can enable it later. Log Format You can skip this for now. I’ll keep it simple. Log File No need to fill this in unless you have specific logging requirements. Load SSL Certificate by IP Addresses Don’t check this unless you’re specifically using IP-based SSL certificates. Load Application by IP Addresses Uncheck this unless your setup requires IP-based application loading. Once you’ve filled everything out, hit Save! Your application is officially created, and you\u0026rsquo;re one step closer to deploying it live.\nConfiguring Page Rules Next up, let\u0026rsquo;s make sure everything runs smoothly by configuring Page Rules. This allows you to set conditions and actions for traffic coming to your application.\nCustom Edge Language Rules at the Beginning of This Page Before diving into predefined rules, let’s look at how you can add custom rules using OpenResty\u0026rsquo;s Edge Language. For example, if you want to block requests from specific IPs and log alerts, you can use the following:\nclient-addr !~~ any (192.168.100.1) =\u0026gt; errlog(level: \u0026#34;alert\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;SEC-00- Unauthorized IP!\u0026#34;, foreign-call(module: \u0026#34;headers-log\u0026#34;, func: \u0026#34;go\u0026#34;) ~ req-body()), exit(444); This rule does two things:\nBlocks traffic from the IP 192.168.100.1. Logs an alert with the message \u0026ldquo;Unauthorized IP!\u0026rdquo;. Feel free to tweak these rules to fit your specific needs. After adding them, hit Save to apply.\nCreate New Rules Let’s move on to setting up some common rules you\u0026rsquo;ll probably need, starting with redirecting traffic from HTTP to HTTPS.\nRedirect HTTP to HTTPS Redirecting users from HTTP to HTTPS is a great way to improve both security and user experience. Here’s how you can set that up:\nClick on New Rule in the Page Rules section.\nSet the condition to identify when the rule should trigger:\nIn the When section, click Add a new condition. From the Variable dropdown, choose Scheme. In the Operator dropdown, select String =. In the Value dropdown, select http. Add the Action to redirect traffic: Under the Actions section, click Add a new action. From the Action Types dropdown, choose Redirect. Set the following fields: URI: Choose current. URI arguments: Choose current. Scheme: Set this to https. Host: Choose current. Port: Set this to blank value. Status Code: Choose 302 Moved Temporarily. This will ensure all users trying to access your site via HTTP will be securely redirected to HTTPS.\nSet Proxy Header If your application relies on specific headers to proxy traffic correctly, you’ll want to configure that as well. Let’s set up a rule to ensure the correct host header is passed along:\nClick on New Rule in the Page Rules section.\nSet the condition for when this rule should apply:\nIn the When section, click Add a new condition. From the Variable dropdown, choose Host. In the Value field, choose String, then type your domain, e.g., tomi-example.co.id. Set the first action to modify the Host header: Under the Actions section, click Add a new action. From the Action Types dropdown, choose Set proxy header. Set the following fields: Header: Enter Host. Value: Choose String and enter your domain, e.g., tomi-example.co.id. Add a second action to append the X-Forwarded-For header: Under the Actions section, click Add a new action again. From the Action Types dropdown, choose Append proxy header value. Set the following fields: Header: Choose X-Forwarded-For. Value: Choose Built-in Variable and select Client address. Configure the Proxy settings: Scroll down to the Proxy section to On. Select the appropriate Proxy to upstream from the dropdown, e.g., example-backend. For Balancing Policy, choose Round Robin This ensures the correct headers are sent to the backend and helps maintain a smooth user experience.\nAdd Custom Edge Language Rules at the End of This Page To improve site performance, caching static assets like JavaScript and CSS is a great practice. Here’s how you can set up cache rules:\nuri-suffix( rx:s/\\.(?:js|css|xml).{0,3}$/), req-method(\u0026#34;GET\u0026#34;)=\u0026gt; enable-proxy-cache(key: uri), enforce-proxy-cache(7 [day]), set-resp-header(\u0026#34;Cache-Control\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;public, max-age=604800, immutable\u0026#34;); uri-suffix( rx:s/\\.(?:gif|png|js|css|html|jpg|wof|svg|woff2|ttf|otf|eot|ico).{0,5}$/), req-method(\u0026#34;GET\u0026#34;)=\u0026gt; enable-proxy-cache(key: uri), enforce-proxy-cache(365 [day]), set-resp-header(\u0026#34;Cache-Control\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;public, max-age=3153600, immutable\u0026#34;); This speeds up load times by storing frequently requested assets for a longer period.\nConfiguring Upstreams Now, let’s make sure your app knows where to send requests by configuring an upstream server (where your app\u0026rsquo;s backend lives).\nClick on Upstreams from your dashboard menu.\nAdd a New Upstream and fill out the details:\nFields What to Enter Upstream Name Enter a name for your upstream, like example-backend. Protocol Choose HTTPS. Host Enter the domain or IP address of your backend server (e.g., tomi-backend.int). Port Set this to 443. Weight Set it to 1. Enabled Switch this On. After everything is set, click Save! Configuring SSL Setting up SSL is key to securing your users\u0026rsquo; data. You\u0026rsquo;ll need to work with your DevOps team to get your SSL certificates in place, but here\u0026rsquo;s how you can set things up in the OpenResty Edge dashboard.\nManage SSL Certificates In the SSL menu, you\u0026rsquo;ll see a table to manage certificates. Here’s what you’ll typically need:\nYour SSL certificate (provided by a Certificate Authority). The private key associated with the certificate. Your domain, pointing to the correct gateway cluster. Make sure all of these details are in order before proceeding.\nCheck Gateway Clusters Lastly, double-check the Gateway Clusters tab. Ensure the IP addresses listed here match the setup for your domain to avoid any connection issues.\nYou\u0026rsquo;re almost done! Once you\u0026rsquo;re satisfied with all the configurations, click the Release button. This will push your changes live, and your app will officially be up and running!\nAnd there you have it! Your new application is now up and running, with all the necessary rules and configurations in place. If you have any questions or run into any issues, don’t hesitate to reach out. Here’s to smooth sailing and successful deployments!\nFeel free to revisit this guide anytime you need a refresher or have new tweaks to make. Happy configuring!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/creating-a-new-app-on-openresty-edge/","summary":"Welcome aboard!

Great choice! Setting up Grafana alerts and integrating them with Slack and Jira through n8n is a powerful way to keep your team on the ball. Let’s dive in and get those workflows automated!\nSetting Up Grafana Alerts First up, let’s get your Grafana alerts configured so you’re always in the know. Here’s the lowdown on how to get your alerts up and running:\nPick Your Data Source Start by selecting where your data is coming from. Grafana’s got your back with a bunch of data source options.\nQuery Your Data Dive into the data you want to keep an eye on. Use queries to drill down to the metrics or logs you care about.\nNormalize Your Data Get your data in shape! Make sure it’s consistent and ready for analysis.\nSet Your Threshold Define what makes your alert go off. What’s the magic number or condition that means it’s time to pay attention?\nCreate Queries, Expressions, and Conditions Craft the queries and set the conditions that will trigger your alert.\nNote: Expressions are a Grafana-managed feature, so they’re only available if you’re using Grafana\u0026rsquo;s own alerting.\nHow Should Your Alerts Be Evaluated?\nDecide how often you want Grafana to check if your alert conditions are met. More frequent checks mean quicker notifications, but it might also mean more noise.\nLabels and Notifications\nThink about how you want to route your alerts. Adding labels can help you categorize and find your alerts more easily.\nAnnotations\nWant to add a little extra detail? Annotations let you include context in your notifications—like what caused the alert and which server it came from.\nReady to get started? With these steps, you’ll be on top of your data in no time!\nConfigure Grafana-managed alert rules Grafana-managed alerts are super flexible and let you pull data from any of our supported data sources. You can even combine data from different sources in one alert rule and use expressions to tweak your data and set up your alert conditions. Plus, you can include images in your notifications. Here’s how you can create and manage these alerts:\nStep 1: Set Alert Rule Name Click on Alerts \u0026amp; IRM -\u0026gt; Alert rules -\u0026gt; + New alert rule. Enter a name for your alert rule. This name helps you identify it in your list and shows up as the alertname label for all alerts created from this rule.\nStep 2: Define Query and Condition Set up a query to fetch the data you want and define a condition that must be met before the alert triggers.\nPick a data source. Choose a time range from the Options dropdown. Note: Grafana Alerting supports fixed relative time ranges like now-24hr: now, but not absolute time ranges (e.g., 2021-12-02 00:00:00 to 2021-12-05 23:59:59) or semi-relative time ranges (e.g., now/d to: now).\nAdd a query. To add more queries, click Add query.\nAll alert rules are managed by Grafana by default. If you prefer data source-managed alert rules, click Switch to data source-managed alert rule.\nAdd one or more expressions. a. Choose either Classic condition for a single alert rule or select Math, Reduce, and Resample options for separate alerts per series.\nb. Click Preview to check if the expression is working.\nTo add a recovery threshold, turn on the Custom recovery threshold toggle and enter a value for when your alert rule should stop firing. You can only add one recovery threshold in a query, and it must be the alert condition.\nClick Set as alert condition on the query or expression you want to use as your alert condition. Step 3: Set Alert Evaluation Behavior Determine how often the alert rule should be evaluated and how quickly it should change its state.\nChoose a folder or click + New folder. Select an evaluation group or click + New evaluation group. If you’re creating a new evaluation group, set the interval for the group.\nAll rules within the same group are evaluated together over the same time interval.\nSet a pending period. The pending period is how long an alert rule can be in breach of the condition before it triggers.\nOnce the condition is met, the alert goes into the Pending state. If it stays active for the entire pending period, it changes to the Firing state; otherwise, it goes back to the Normal state.\nTurn on pause alert notifications if needed. Note: You can pause alert rule evaluation to avoid noisy alerts while you’re tuning them. Pausing stops evaluation and doesn’t create alert instances. This is different from mute timings, which stop notifications but still allow evaluation and creation of alert instances.\nIn Configure no data and error handling, set how you want the alert to behave when there’s no data. Step 4: Configure Labels and Notifications Add labels to organize your alert rules and set up notification policies for your alerts.\nAdd labels if needed. You can select existing key-value pairs from a dropdown or enter new ones.\nChoose how notifications are sent when an alert fires by either selecting a contact point or using a notification policy. Select contact point\na. Pick this option to select an existing contact point. All notifications for this alert rule will go to this contact point automatically, bypassing notification policies.\nb. Optionally, select a mute timing and groupings to define when notifications shouldn’t be sent.\nNote: An auto-generated notification policy is created. Only admins can view these auto-generated policies in the Notification policies list view. Any changes need to be made in the alert rules form.\nUse notification policy\na. Choose this to use the notification policy tree for routing notifications.\nNote: All alert rules and instances follow the default notification policy. If there are no nested policies or if no nested policies match the labels in the alert rule or instance, the default policy is used.\nb. Preview your alert instance routing setup.\nBased on the labels added, alert instances will be routed according to the notification policies shown.\nc. Expand each notification policy below to view more details.\nd. Click See details to check alert routing details and an email preview.\nStep 5: Add Annotations Add annotations to provide extra context in your alert notification messages.\nAnnotations add metadata to give more information about the alert. For instance, a Summary annotation can explain which value caused the alert or which server it happened on.\nOptional: Add a summary. A brief explanation of what happened and why. Optional: Add a description. Detail what the alert rule does. Optional: Add a Runbook URL. A webpage link to your runbook for the alert. Optional: Add a custom annotation. Optional: Add a dashboard and panel link. Link alerts to specific panels in a dashboard. Note: Currently, alerts are supported only in time series and alert list visualizations.\nClick Save rule. Configure Contact Points Use contact points to pick how you want to get notified when your alert rules go off. You can add, edit, delete, export, and test a contact point.\nStep 1: Add a Contact Point Here’s how to add a contact point:\nIn the left-side menu, click on Alerts \u0026amp; IRM and then Alerting. Click on Contact Points. From the Choose Alertmanager dropdown, pick an Alertmanager. Grafana Alertmanager is the default option. On the Contact Points tab, click + Add Contact Point. Enter a name for your contact point. From Integration, select the type and fill in the required fields. For example, if you choose email, enter the email addresses. Or if you choose Slack, enter the Slack channel and the users you want to contact. Some integrations, like email or Webhook, have optional settings. In Optional Settings, you can add extra settings for the integration. In Notification Settings, you can choose to Disable Resolved Message if you don’t want to be notified when an alert is resolved. If you want to add another contact point integration, click Add Contact Point Integration and repeat steps 6 through 8. Save your changes. Step 2: Test a Contact Point Here’s how to test a contact point:\nIn the left-side menu, click on Alerts \u0026amp; IRM and then Alerting. Click on Contact Points to see your list of contact points. Find the contact point you want to test, then click Edit. You can also create a new contact point if needed. Click Test to open the testing dialog box. Choose whether to send a predefined test notification or go custom by adding your own annotations and labels. Click Send Test Notification to trigger the alert. Configure Notification Policies Notification policies help you decide how alerts are sent to your contact points. They work in a tree-like structure where each policy can have one or more nested policies. Except for the default policy, each one can match specific alert labels.\nStep 1: Add a Nested Policy You can create a nested policy under the default one or under any existing nested policy. Here’s how you do it:\nGo to the left-side menu and click Alerts \u0026amp; IRM, then Alerting. Click Notification policies. Click +New nested policy from the default policy. In the Matching labels section, add one or more rules to match alert labels. From the Contact point dropdown, choose the contact point to send notifications to if an alert matches this specific policy and not any nested policies. [Optional] If you want alerts to keep matching sibling policies after finding a match, enable Continue matching subsequent sibling nodes. This option can result in multiple notifications for the same alert.\n[Optional] To use the same grouping settings as the default policy, enable Override grouping. If this isn’t enabled, it’ll use the default policy’s grouping settings.\n[Optional] To override the timing options set in the group notification policy, enable Override general timings.\nClick Save policy to apply your changes.\nBuild Your n8n Create custom workflows between Grafana, Slack, and Jira by picking triggers and actions. Each node comes with general settings, plus app-specific options you can tweak. You can also use the HTTP Request node to pull data from any app or service with a REST API. Ready to bring it all together? Here’s how you can set up a workflow:\nHow to Connect Grafana, Slack, and Jira Step 1: Set up n8n First, make sure n8n is installed and running:\nInstall n8n on any platform using npm or Docker. Or, let n8n handle it for you with its cloud hosting. Step 2: Create a New Workflow to Connect Grafana, Slack, and Jira Open n8n, go to the Workflows tab, and click Add workflow to start a new one.\nStep 3: Add the First Step Decide what will kick off your workflow: a schedule, a webhook call, another workflow, or manually. Sometimes Grafana, Slack, or Jira can be your starting point. Just click Open nodes panel, search for Grafana, Slack, or Jira, or choose a trigger. For this case, drag the webhook node onto the canvas—it\u0026rsquo;ll serve as the contact point. Just like before, copy and paste the URL there.\nStep 4: Add the Slack Node Drag the Slack node onto the canvas. Choose what you want Slack to do before dragging.\nStep 5: Authenticate Slack Click on the Slack node, then select Select credential next to the Credential to connect with field. Follow the prompts to link n8n to your Slack account.\nStep 6: Add the Jira Node Drag the Jira node from the nodes panel to the workflow canvas. Choose the action you want Jira to perform before dragging, such as creating an issue or updating a task.\nStep 7: Authenticate Jira Click on the Jira node, then click the Select credential dropdown option next to the Credential to connect with field. Follow the instructions to connect n8n to your Jira account. Make sure you have the right permissions in Jira to perform the desired actions.\nStep 8: Configure Slack and Jira Nodes Click on each node to adjust settings. On the left, you’ll see the input data. In the middle, set up parameters like resources and operations. The output will appear on the right.\nStep 9: Connect Webhook, Slack, and Jira Link the nodes together in the order you need. For example, you can connect Grafana’s Webhook output to Slack, then link Slack’s output to Jira, or rearrange them to fit your workflow.\nStep 10: Customize Your Webhook, Slack, and Jira Integration Use n8n’s core nodes to shape the data and extend your setup:\nSplitting: IF, Switch Merging: Merge, Compare Datasets Looping: IF, Loop Over Items Waiting: Wait Sub-workflows: Execute Workflow, Execute Workflow Trigger Error Handling: Stop And Error, Error Trigger Code: Write custom JavaScript or Python code and run it within your workflow. Step 11: Save and Activate Workflow After configuring Webhook (Grafana), Slack, Jira, and any extra nodes, save your workflow and activate it. Once active, the workflow will automatically run whenever a trigger node gets input or meets a condition. New workflows start deactivated by default.\nStep 12: Test the Workflow Run the workflow to see if everything’s working between Webhook (Grafana), Slack, and Jira. Depending on your setup, data should move smoothly between them. If something goes wrong, you can debug by checking past runs to spot and fix mistakes.\nWrap-Up Setting up Grafana alerts and integrating with tools like Slack and Jira boosts your monitoring and incident management by automating notifications and streamlining responses to critical issues. With your alerts, contact points, and notification policies in place, your setup is ready to keep you informed and proactive. Experiment with conditions, refine alerts, and customize integrations to fit your needs. This powerful combo helps you stay on top of your data, tackle issues before they escalate, and keep everything running smoothly.\nHappy monitoring, and may your alerts always be insightful!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/integrating-grafana-slack-and-jira/","summary":"So, you’re ready to up your game and make sure you never miss a critical update?

Gophish is a powerful open-source phishing framework designed to make the process of conducting and managing phishing campaigns as straightforward as possible. Think of it as your go-to tool for simulating real-world phishing attacks. The best part? It\u0026rsquo;s free and easy to use!\nAffordable: Gophish is open-source software, which means you don\u0026rsquo;t have to pay a cent to use it. Accessible: Written in the Go programming language, Gophish releases are compiled binaries with no dependencies. This means installation is as easy as \u0026ldquo;download and run.\u0026rdquo; Deploying Gophish on GCP Alright, let\u0026rsquo;s dive into how you can get Gophish up and running on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).\nStep 1: Create a Google Compute Engine Instance First things first, we need a virtual machine (VM) on Google Cloud Platform. Go to your GCP console and create a new Google Compute Engine instance. Choose the \u0026ldquo;N1\u0026rdquo; machine type and stick with the default settings.\nStep 2: SSH into Your VM Once your VM is set up, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to connect to it. Use the SSH feature in the GCP console to access your VM, and then run these commands:\nsudo adduser -c \u0026#34;Gophish\u0026#34; gophish sudo su - gophish curl -L https://github.com/gophish/gophish/releases/download/v0.11.0/gophish-v0.11.0-linux-64bit.zip -o gophish-v0.11.0-linux-64bit.zip mkdir gophish-v0.11.0 cd gophish-v0.11.0 sudo apt-get install unzip unzip ../gophish-v0.11.0-linux-64bit.zip rm ../gophish-v0.11.0-linux-64bit.zip Here\u0026rsquo;s a quick breakdown of what these commands do:\nWe create a new user called \u0026ldquo;gophish\u0026rdquo; and switch to that user. We download the Gophish zip file from GitHub using curl. We create a directory for Gophish and unzip the downloaded file into it. Step 3: Exploring the Extracted Files Once the zip file is extracted, you\u0026rsquo;ll find several files, but the most important one is config.json.\nConfiguring config.json\nThe config.json file contains settings for two servers:\nadmin_server: This server hosts the admin console where you can create and manage phishing campaigns. By default, it runs on \u0026ldquo;127.0.0.1:3333\u0026rdquo;, but we\u0026rsquo;ll change this to \u0026ldquo;0.0.0.0:3333\u0026rdquo; so it can be accessed from anywhere. phish_server: This server hosts the phishing landing pages. By default, it runs on \u0026ldquo;0.0.0.0:80\u0026rdquo;, but we\u0026rsquo;ll change this to \u0026ldquo;0.0.0.0:5555\u0026rdquo; to avoid issues with privileged ports. Step 4: Adding Firewall Rules in GCP Next, we need to create firewall rules to allow traffic to our Gophish instance on ports 3333 and 5555.\nStep-by-Step Firewall Configuration\nGo to Google Cloud Console. From the left navigation menu, select VPC Network and then Firewall rules. Click the Create Firewall Rule button. Configure the Firewall Rule. Click Create to save the firewall rule. Example Configuration:\nParameter Details Name Give the firewall rule a name, like \u0026ldquo;allow-gophish-ports\u0026rdquo;. Network Select the appropriate network, usually \u0026ldquo;default\u0026rdquo;. Priority Leave default or set a priority as needed. Direction of Traffic Select Ingress. Action on Match Select Allow. Targets Choose All instances in the network or restrict to specific VMs using tags. Source IP Ranges Enter \u0026ldquo;0.0.0.0/0\u0026rdquo; to allow access from all IP addresses, or restrict to specific IP ranges if needed. Protocols and Ports Select Specified protocols and ports and enter \u0026ldquo;tcp:3333,5555\u0026rdquo;\u0026quot;. Starting the Gophish Service Now that everything is set up, we can start the Gophish service. Run the following command in your SSH session:\nsudo ./gophish Accessing Gophish To access the Gophish admin console, open your web browser and navigate to \u0026ldquo;https://\u0026lt;YOUR_VM_IP\u0026gt;:3333\u0026rdquo;. You\u0026rsquo;ll see the Gophish login screen:\nLogging In When you start Gophish, it will display the default login credentials in the terminal. Use these credentials to log in.\nNote: Gophish takes security seriously. The default password is unique for each deployment, and you\u0026rsquo;ll be prompted to change it immediately after your first login.\nThe Gophish Admin Console Once you\u0026rsquo;re logged in, you\u0026rsquo;ll be greeted by the Gophish dashboard. Here\u0026rsquo;s a quick rundown of the main sections:\nDashboard: Provides an overview of your campaigns and their performance. Campaigns: Create and manage phishing campaigns tailored to different teams or purposes. Users and Groups: Add user emails and group them. You can also import emails from a CSV file. Email Templates: Design and manage phishing email templates. Landing Pages: Set up landing pages and track user interactions. Sending Profiles: Configure sender details for your phishing emails. Here\u0026rsquo;s a sneak peek at the Gophish admin console:\nConclusion And that\u0026rsquo;s it! You\u0026rsquo;ve successfully set up Gophish on Google Cloud Platform. With Gophish, you can easily create and manage phishing campaigns to train your team and improve your organization\u0026rsquo;s security awareness.\nGophish is a fantastic option for small businesses with tight budgets, offering powerful features without the hefty price tag of other solutions.

So, grab your tools and get ready to unleash your inner hacker (for good, of course)!\nFinding the Target: Local and Target IP Addresses Before I launch my attack, I need to pinpoint the target machine\u0026rsquo;s location on the network. This is akin to finding a pirate ship on the high seas (except way less swashbuckling).\nStep 1: Find Your Local IP Address First things first, I\u0026rsquo;ll identify my local IP address. This serves as my starting point for finding the target\u0026rsquo;s IP. I can usually find this in my network settings.\nkali@kali:~$ ifconfig Local IP Address: 192.168.100.9\nStep 2: Scan for Active Devices Next, I\u0026rsquo;ll use a tool called netdiscover to scan for active devices on the network. Think of it as a hi-tech radar that helps me spot my target ship.\nkali@kali:~$ sudo netdiscover -i eth0 -r 192.168.100.9/24 Target IP Address: 192.168.100.8\nNow I have the target\u0026rsquo;s IP address! High fives all around!\nScanning for Open Ports With my target in sight, it\u0026rsquo;s time to gather some intel. I\u0026rsquo;ll use a powerful tool called nmap to scan the target machine and identify any open ports. These ports act like doorways into the system, and I\u0026rsquo;ll be looking for any that might be vulnerable.\nkali@kali:~$ nmap -p- -A 192.168.100.8 The scan might reveal something like this:\nPort Service Version 21 FTP ProFTPD 1.3.3c 22 SSH OpenSSH 7.2p2 Ubuntu 80 HTTP Apache httpd 2.4.18 This information is like a treasure map, guiding me towards potential weaknesses!\nExploring the Web Server (Port 80) My scan revealed an open port 80, which usually indicates a web server. Let\u0026rsquo;s set my sights on this port and see what I can find.\nStep 1: Visit the Target IP I visit the target\u0026rsquo;s IP address in my browser, but the website doesn\u0026rsquo;t reveal much.\nStep 2: Check for Hidden Files I check the page source and robots.txt file (a file that tells search engines which parts of the website to crawl) for any hidden clues, but come up empty-handed.\nHold on, don\u0026rsquo;t despair! This is just the beginning.\nDiscovering Hidden Directories with dirb Since the website itself isn\u0026rsquo;t giving anything away, I\u0026rsquo;ll use a tool called dirb. Think of it as a metal detector that helps me unearth hidden directories and files on the website.\ndirb scans the website and reveals some intriguing URLs that warrant further investigation.\nStep 1: Run dirb kali@kali:~$ dirb http://192.168.100.8 /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -o dirb.txt Step 2: Find Interesting URLs One of the URLs dirb found leads me to a path called \u0026ldquo;secret.\u0026rdquo; Sounds promising, right? I navigate to this path, but the page seems broken and the links don\u0026rsquo;t work.\nUpon closer inspection, I notice that the links use a domain name (\u0026quot;vtcsec\u0026quot;) instead of the IP address. This is a small hurdle, but I can fix it!\nFixing Domain Issues with the Hosts File To make those links work properly, I need to create a little map. I\u0026rsquo;ll edit a file called \u0026ldquo;hosts\u0026rdquo; on my machine, which tells my computer how to translate domain names into IP addresses.\nStep 1: Edit the Hosts File kali@kali:~$ sudo nano /etc/hosts Step 2: Add a line for the domain name In this file, I\u0026rsquo;ll add a new line that associates the domain name \u0026ldquo;vtcsec\u0026rdquo; with the target machine\u0026rsquo;s IP address.\nNow, when I try those links again, they should work like a charm!\nCracking the WordPress Login Panel After fixing the domain issue, the \u0026ldquo;secret\u0026rdquo; page finally displays properly. But here\u0026rsquo;s the twist: it leads me to a familiar sight – a WordPress login panel!\nThis is a golden opportunity! WordPress can sometimes be vulnerable, and I can use a tool called WPScan to exploit those vulnerabilities.\nStep 1: Use WPScan With WPScan in hand, I\u0026rsquo;ll conduct user enumeration to uncover potential usernames on the WordPress login panel. This step is crucial as it helps me identify accounts I can potentially exploit.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll fire up WPScan with the following command:\nkali@kali:~$ wpscan --url https://192.168.100.8/secret/ enumerate -u This command instructs WPScan to enumerate usernames on the specified URL. I\u0026rsquo;ll keep my eyes peeled for any usernames that might come up! Using WPScan, I might be able to find a username like \u0026ldquo;admin\u0026rdquo;.\nStep 2: Crack Passwords Now that I have some potential usernames, it\u0026rsquo;s time to crack some passwords! I\u0026rsquo;ll use WPScan again, this time with a wordlist to brute-force my way into the system.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the command I\u0026rsquo;ll use:\nkali@kali:~$ wpscan --url http://vtcsec/secret/ --username admin --passwords /path/to/wordlist.txt --force I\u0026rsquo;ll replace \u0026ldquo;/path/to/wordlist.txt\u0026rdquo; with the path to my chosen wordlist. WPScan will then attempt to crack the password for the \u0026ldquo;admin\u0026rdquo; user.\nSuccess! I\u0026rsquo;ve managed to breach the WordPress login panel using the credentials I uncovered. Now, I\u0026rsquo;m inside the system, ready to explore and exploit further.\nBut wait, there\u0026rsquo;s more!\nGaining Access: Upload a PHP Shell Now that I have access to the WordPress panel, it\u0026rsquo;s time to take things up a notch. I\u0026rsquo;ll inject a malicious PHP script to establish a reverse shell connection from the target machine to my attacker machine.\nStep 1: Prepare the PHP Shell I\u0026rsquo;ll use a popular PHP reverse shell script, such as the one found at GitHub.\nStep 2: Inject the Script I\u0026rsquo;ll head over to the Appearance section in the WordPress panel and select the Editor. From there, I\u0026rsquo;ll navigate to the Theme Header (header.php) file.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll delete any existing code in the file and replace it with the malicious PHP script code I obtained earlier. Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to update the IP address to your attacker machine\u0026rsquo;s IP and choose a port that isn\u0026rsquo;t in use.\nSave the changes, and now the trap is set!\nStep 3: Set Up Netcat Listener With the malicious PHP script in place, all that\u0026rsquo;s left to do is wait. I\u0026rsquo;ll fire up netcat on my attacker machine to listen for incoming connections:\nkali@kali:~$ nc -lvnp \u0026lt;chosen_port\u0026gt; Step 4: Trigger the PHP Shell Now, I\u0026rsquo;ll simply revisit the target URL where I injected the script, and voila! I\u0026rsquo;ll receive a connection on my netcat listener, confirming that I\u0026rsquo;ve successfully established a reverse shell connection.\nAnd there you have it – from reconnaissance to exploitation, I\u0026rsquo;ve conquered Vulnhub\u0026rsquo;s Basic Pentesting 1 like a true penetration testing pro!\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s Next? As I continue my cybersecurity journey, I\u0026rsquo;ll keep learning, exploring, and expanding my skillset. There\u0026rsquo;s always more to discover in this ever-evolving field. Whether I\u0026rsquo;m a beginner or an experienced professional, there\u0026rsquo;s always room to grow and improve.\nSo, I\u0026rsquo;ll take what I\u0026rsquo;ve learned here and apply it wisely. I\u0026rsquo;ll use my newfound knowledge to protect systems, strengthen defenses, and make the digital world a safer place for all.\nHappy hacking, and may my exploits always be in the service of good!\nUntil next time, stay curious, stay vigilant, and keep hacking responsibly.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/vulnhub-basic-pentesting-1/","summary":"Have you ever wanted to test your penetration testing skills in a safe environment?

This blog post will take you through the exciting journey of dissecting a suspicious file using Cuckoo Sandbox, a powerful tool for both static and dynamic analysis.\nStep-by-Step Malware Analysis with Cuckoo Sandbox Step 1: Unpacking the Suspect After downloading the sample file, I unzipped it to reveal its contents. This initial step allows us to see what\u0026rsquo;s lurking inside the archive.\ncuckoo@cuckoo-sandbox:~$ cd Documents cuckoo@cuckoo-sandbox:~$ unzip PowerShellScript.zip Step 2: Setting Up a Safe Environment To create a safe environment for the analysis, I fired up a separate virtual machine running Windows. This isolated space ensures that the malware can\u0026rsquo;t wreak havoc on my actual system. It\u0026rsquo;s like having a controlled experiment to observe the malware\u0026rsquo;s behavior!\ncuckoo@cuckoo-sandbox:~$ sudo virtualbox Step 3: Launching Cuckoo Sandbox With the virtual machine prepped, I launched the Cuckoo Sandbox tools. This versatile software provides a user-friendly interface to conduct both static and dynamic analysis of the malware. Think of it as a magnifying glass and a microscope combined, allowing us to see the malware from different angles.\ncuckoo@cuckoo-sandbox:~$ sudo cuckoo -d Step 4: Running the Local Web Server To access Cuckoo Sandbox\u0026rsquo;s interface conveniently, I also ran a local web server. This lets me analyze the malware from the comfort of a web browser, just like browsing any other website.\ncuckoo@cuckoo-sandbox:~$ sudo cuckoo web runserver Step 5: Accessing the Sandbox Interface After a successful launch, I was greeted by the Cuckoo Sandbox interface. It\u0026rsquo;s the mission control center from where we\u0026rsquo;ll be dissecting the malware\u0026rsquo;s secrets.\nStep 6: Importing the Sample for Analysis The next step was crucial. I imported the suspicious file into Cuckoo Sandbox for a thorough examination. This is like putting the malware under the scanner to see what makes it tick.\nStep 7: Observing Malware Behavior Cuckoo Sandbox then did its magic. It executed the malware within a simulated environment inside the Windows virtual machine. This lets us observe how the malware behaves in a controlled setting, mimicking a real-world attack scenario.\nStep 8: Reviewing the Analysis Report Once the malware finished its execution, Cuckoo Sandbox presented the analysis report. This report is like a treasure trove of information, revealing the malware\u0026rsquo;s characteristics and potential threats.\nKey Findings Malware Signatures The report highlighted the malware\u0026rsquo;s distinctive signatures. These signatures are like fingerprints, helping us identify the type of malware we\u0026rsquo;re dealing with and potentially link it to known threats.\nScreenshots of Activity Scrolling down the report, I found screenshots capturing the virtual machine\u0026rsquo;s activities during the malware execution. These screenshots provide valuable visual evidence of the malware\u0026rsquo;s actions.\nStatic Analysis Results The initial static analysis, which examines the code without actually running it, didn\u0026rsquo;t yield any significant results. This often happens with encrypted malware, where the malicious code is hidden from plain sight.\nStrings Analysis However, the strings analysis proved more fruitful. Here, I discovered strings associated with keyloggers. Keyloggers are malicious programs designed to steal your keystrokes, potentially revealing passwords, login credentials, and other sensitive information you might type. This finding suggested that the malware aimed to spy on the target user\u0026rsquo;s activities.\nMissing Behavioral Data Unfortunately, the behavioral analysis section of the report lacked data. This page typically details the malware\u0026rsquo;s interactions with the system, such as accessing the registry, manipulating files, or communicating over the network. The absence of data in this section could be due to various reasons, requiring further investigation.\nConclusion: Keylogger Confirmed The analysis using Cuckoo Sandbox revealed several key points. The presence of specific signatures and the discovery of keylogger-related strings strongly suggested that we were dealing with a malicious program designed to steal user data.\nFurthermore, the potential exfiltration of captured data to an attacker\u0026rsquo;s email address highlighted the urgency to take action.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/malware-analysis-protergo/","summary":"During my technical interview at Protergo, I had the opportunity to showcase my skills in malware analysis.
