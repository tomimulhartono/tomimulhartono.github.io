## Delving into the Challenges of Stakeholder Complaint Management

As a **Full Stack Developer** at **PT Motiolabs Digital Indonesia**, I had the opportunity to contribute to the development of an innovative web application: **Sistem Monitoring Pelayanan Bidang Informasi dan Pengaduan Stakeholders (SIMONA BIDUAN).**

SIMONA BIDUAN emerged as a comprehensive software solution to manage and track stakeholder complaints, particularly within the Ministry of Law and Human Rights of the Republic of Indonesia (Kemenkumham RI).

**Key challenges** faced in managing stakeholder complaints at Kemenkumham RI included:
- **Lack of a centralized platform** to receive and track complaints from various stakeholders.
- **Manual processes** that were time-consuming and inefficient in handling complaints.
- **Limited visibility** into the status of complaints and their resolution process.

## Building SIMONA BIDUAN: A Collaborative and Efficient Solution

Working alongside a colleague, I was involved in the development of SIMONA BIDUAN from start to finish, spanning from September 2023 to November 2023.

### Technologies used

- **Framework:** CodeIgniter 3
- **Database:** MySQL

### Core features of SIMONA BIDUAN

- **Complaint Portal:** A platform for stakeholders to submit complaints, report issues, or provide feedback on services.
- **Complaint Management System:** Enables the internal team to review, categorize, and resolve complaints effectively.
- **Status Tracking:** Provides real-time visibility into complaint status and the resolution process.
- **Reports and Analytics:** Generates data and insights to aid decision-making and service improvement.

## Positive Impact of SIMONA BIDUAN
The implementation of SIMONA BIDUAN has yielded significant positive impacts, including:

- **Increased efficiency:** The complaint management process has become more streamlined and structured.
- **Improved communication:** Enhances communication and collaboration between internal and external stakeholders.
- **Enhanced transparency:** Provides visibility into complaint status and the resolution process.
- **Better decision-making:** Data and insights generated assist in making informed decisions to improve services.
