Imagine dealing with a flood of complaints every day without a clear system to organize, track, or resolve them. That was the challenge for **Kemenkumham RI** (Ministry of Law and Human Rights, Indonesia). Complaints were piling up in scattered systems, manual processes slowed things down, and stakeholders had no clue about the status of their issues.

That’s where **SIMONA BIDUAN** (short for *Sistem Monitoring Pelayanan Bidang Informasi dan Pengaduan Stakeholders*) comes in—a web application I had the opportunity to create from scratch between September and November 2023.

---

## The Problem at a Glance

1. **No Central Hub:** Complaints were handled through fragmented systems, creating chaos.
2. **Manual Hassles:** Inefficient processes led to delays.
3. **Lack of Transparency:** Stakeholders were left in the dark about complaint statuses.

---

## The Solution: SIMONA BIDUAN

I built SIMONA BIDUAN to address these pain points, leveraging the **CodeIgniter 3 framework** and a **MySQL database.** The app isn’t just a complaint management tool—it’s a full-blown system for **improving communication,** **streamlining operations,** and **empowering data-driven decisions.**

**Core Features**

1. **Complaint Portal**

- A one-stop platform for stakeholders to submit complaints, share feedback, and raise issues.

2. **Complaint Management System**

- Tools for internal teams to review, categorize, and resolve complaints seamlessly.

3. **Real-Time Status Tracking**

- Keep stakeholders in the loop with progress updates and resolution timelines.

4. **Reports & Analytics**

- Turn data into insights to improve services and decision-making.

## Why It Matters

Here’s what SIMONA BIDUAN brings to the table:

1. **Faster Processes:** Manual work? Out. Organized workflows? In.
2. **Better Communication:** Connect stakeholders and teams more effectively.
3. **Transparency:** No more mystery around complaint statuses.
4. **Smarter Decisions:** Analytics to guide meaningful improvements.

A lead from the project summed it up perfectly:

>“**SIMONA BIDUAN** has become an invaluable tool for Kemenkumham RI in enhancing service quality and stakeholder satisfaction.”
