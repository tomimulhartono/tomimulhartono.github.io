![SIMONA BIDUAN](/images/simona.jpg)

At **PT Motiolabs Digital Indonesia**, I had the exciting opportunity to develop a cutting-edge web application: **Sistem Monitoring Pelayanan Bidang Informasi dan Pengaduan Stakeholders (SIMONA BIDUAN)**. This project was designed to tackle the challenges of managing stakeholder complaints for the Ministry of Law and Human Rights of the Republic of Indonesia (Kemenkumham RI).

---

## What Was the Problem?
Kemenkumham RI faced several issues in managing stakeholder complaints:

- **No Central Hub:** Complaints were managed through disjointed systems, making tracking and management challenging.
- **Manual Processes:** The existing system was slow and inefficient, relying on time-consuming manual work.
- **Visibility Gaps:** Limited insight into the status and resolution of complaints.

---

## How I Solved It
I independently developed SIMONA BIDUAN from September 2023 to November 2023. Here’s how I tackled the project:

### Tech Stack
- **Framework:** CodeIgniter 3
- **Database:** MySQL

### Core Features
- **Complaint Portal:** A centralized platform for stakeholders to submit complaints, report issues, and provide feedback.
- **Management System:** Tools for reviewing, categorizing, and resolving complaints effectively.
- **Status Tracking:** Real-time updates on the progress and resolution of complaints.
- **Reports & Analytics:** Data-driven insights to support better decision-making and service improvements.

---

## Why It Matters
SIMONA BIDUAN has made a significant impact by:

- **Boosting Efficiency:** Streamlined and organized complaint handling processes.
- **Enhancing Communication:** Improved interaction between internal teams and stakeholders.
- **Increasing Transparency:** Clear visibility into complaint statuses and resolutions.
- **Supporting Better Decisions:** Insights and data to drive smarter decisions and enhance services.
