![COVID-19 WebGIS](/images/webgis.jpg)

In 2020, I had the chance to contribute to an impactful project: building the **COVID-19 WebGIS** application. The goal was simple but important—creating a web platform that helps people understand the pandemic situation in Indonesia through maps, charts, and data analysis.

---

## What’s COVID-19 WebGIS?

It's a web-based application that provides a visual representation of COVID-19 data in Indonesia. Users can view real-time stats, including case numbers, recoveries, and deaths, all displayed on interactive maps and easy-to-read charts.

---

## Tech Stack and Challenges

We used some powerful tools to bring the project to life:

- **Bootstrap 4** for responsive design, making the app mobile-friendly.
- **ArcMap** for analyzing spatial data.
- **QGIS,** an open-source tool, for visualizing the data on maps.

The biggest challenge? Jumping into a project with limited knowledge and getting up to speed quickly. We had to dive into the existing code and figure out the whole workflow, but through teamwork and persistence, we got it done!

## Features That Matter

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| COVID-19 Spread Map | Shows the number of cases, recoveries, and deaths across different regions in Indonesia. |
| Data Analysis | Provides in-depth details on how COVID-19 is impacting the country. |
| Data Visualization | Easy-to-understand graphs and tables to help users make sense of the data. |

## What I Learned

The experience was packed with learning opportunities, including:

- Gaining skills in web development and GIS.
- Collaborating with a team to meet tight deadlines.
- Knowing that my work helped the community during such a challenging time.

## Final Thoughts

The COVID-19 WebGIS project showed how technology can make a difference in tough times. Even though the internship was short, it was an unforgettable and rewarding experience, and I’m proud to have contributed to something that had a positive impact on people’s lives.
