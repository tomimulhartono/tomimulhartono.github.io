## From Zero to Cyber Security Hero in One Month

It's been a whirlwind of a month, but I'm thrilled to share that I've just completed an intensive Cyber Security Bootcamp at SanberCode! This program was designed to transform individuals with no prior experience into skilled penetration testers and bug hunters. And let me tell you, it was an incredible journey.

## What I Learned

The bootcamp covered a wide range of topics, including:

- **Networking fundamentals:** This gave me a solid understanding of how networks work, which is essential for identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities.
- **Web application security:** I learned how to find and exploit common web application vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting.
- **Penetration testing:** I gained hands-on experience with a variety of penetration testing tools and techniques.
- **Bug hunting:** I learned how to find and report security vulnerabilities in popular software programs.

## The Bootcamp Experience

The bootcamp was led by experienced industry professionals who were passionate about sharing their knowledge. The learning environment was highly collaborative, and I had the opportunity to work on projects with other talented students.

**One of the highlights of the bootcamp was the capstone project.** In this project, we were tasked with finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in a real-world web application. This was a challenging but rewarding experience that gave us a chance to apply the skills we had learned throughout the program.

## My Key Takeaways

Here are a few key takeaways from my bootcamp experience:

- **Cyber security is a fascinating and ever-evolving field.** There's always something new to learn, which keeps things exciting.
- **There's a huge demand for skilled cyber security professionals.** If you're interested in this field, there are plenty of opportunities available.
- **A bootcamp is a great way to learn the skills you need to launch a career in cyber security.** It's an intensive and immersive experience that will give you the knowledge and skills you need to succeed.

## My Next Steps

I'm excited to continue learning and growing in the cyber security field. I'm currently looking for a job as a penetration tester or bug hunter, and I'm confident that I have the skills and experience to be successful.

**I'm also planning to start my own blog to share what I've learned with others.** I hope to inspire others to pursue a career in cyber security and help make the world a safer place.
