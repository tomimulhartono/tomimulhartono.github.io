<!-- Disclaimer: This article is for educational purposes only. It is essential to highlight that attempting any unauthorized actions on a system is illegal and unethical. Always ensure you have proper authorization before conducting any security testing or penetration testing on a network or a target machine.


This guide provides insights into potential methods a malicious actor might utilize to exploit vulnerabilities within a system. However, it aims to reveal these tactics to enhance your understanding and bolster your defense mechanisms against such threats. -->

## The Target: A Vulnhub Machine

Meet the target: Vulnhub Basic Pentesting 1. This machine, released on December 8, 2017, is authored by Josiah Pierce as part of the Basic Pentesting series.

## Finding the Target's IP Address

### Identifying the Local IP

I first need a starting point. My local IP address (like 192.168.100.9 in this example) acts as a launchpad for locating the target machine.

### Netdiscover for IP Scouting

I'll likely use a tool like ``netdiscover`` to scan the network for active devices, revealing the target's IP address (192.168.100.8 in this case).

## Unveiling Open Doors: Nmap Scan

### TCP Ports: The Gateways In

Once I have the IP, I might use nmap to scan for open ports on the target machine. These ports act like doorways, and depending on what services run on those ports (FTP, SSH, HTTP), I can determine potential entry points.

## Web Server Exposed: Port 80

### The Web's Gateway
Port 80 The scan might reveal an open port 80, commonly used for web traffic. This suggests a website is running on the target machine.

## Limited Information Gathering: Initial Website Exploration

### A Blank Page?

Visiting the website's IP address in a browser might not yield much. I might see a limited page with no clear vulnerabilities.

### Peeking Under the Hood: Source Code and Robots.txt

Checking the website's source code and searching for a robots.txt file (which tells search engines what to index) might not expose hidden directories or crucial information.

## Unveiling Hidden Paths: Dirb to the Rescue

### Brute Force with a Twist: Dirb

Since the initial exploration didn't expose much, I might use a tool like Dirb. Dirb uses wordlists to try and discover hidden directories or files on the website that aren't readily apparent.

## A Secret Path Emerges

### Intriguing URL

Dirb might unearth an interesting URL, like http://192.168.100.8/secret/. This sparks my curiosity, prompting further investigation.

## Domain Name Deception: Editing the Hosts File

### Mixing IPs and Domains

Upon visiting the newfound URL, I might encounter issues because the website uses a domain name (like [invalid URL removed]) instead of an IP address in some links. To bridge this gap, I might modify my computer's hosts file to map the domain name to the target's IP address.

### The Login Portal Appears: A Chink in the Armor

### The Login Screen

After editing the hosts file, the website might render correctly, revealing a login page. This is a potential entry point if a valid username and password can be obtained.

## User Hunting: WPScan

### Unmasking the Users

I might employ a tool like WPScan to discover usernames on the website. This information can be valuable for brute-force login attempts.

## Brute-Force Login Attempt

### The Password Attack

Armed with a username and a password list, I might use a tool to launch a brute-force attack, attempting to crack the password and gain access to the website's admin panel.

## Taking Control: Admin Panel Breach

### Success!

If the brute-force attack is successful, I might gain access to the website's administration panel, granting me elevated privileges.

## Escalating Privileges: Code Injection

### Planting a Malicious Script

With control over the admin panel, I might attempt to inject malicious code (like a reverse shell) into the website's files. This code could allow me to establish a persistent connection to the website and potentially steal data or wreak havoc.
