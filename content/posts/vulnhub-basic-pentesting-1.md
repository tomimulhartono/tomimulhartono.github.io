In this guide, I'll walk you through the thrilling journey of taking down Basic Pentesting 1, step-by-step. So, grab your tools and get ready to unleash your inner hacker (for good, of course)!

## Locating Your Target: Identifying the Local and Target IP Addresses

Before I launch my attack, I need to pinpoint the target machine's location on the network. This is akin to finding a pirate ship on the high seas (except way less swashbuckling).

First things first, I'll identify my local IP address. This serves as my starting point for finding the target's IP. I can usually find this in my network settings.

{{< highlight bash >}}

kali@kali:~$ ifconfig

{{< /highlight >}}

![Vulnhub](/images/vulnhub-basic-pentesting-1-2.jpg)

**Local IP Address:** 192.168.100.9

Next, I'll use a tool called ``netdiscover`` to scan for active devices on the network. Think of it as a hi-tech radar that helps me spot my target ship.

{{< highlight bash >}}

kali@kali:~$ sudo netdiscover -i eth0 -r 192.168.100.9/24

{{< /highlight >}}

![Vulnhub](/images/vulnhub-basic-pentesting-1-3.png)

![Vulnhub](/images/vulnhub-basic-pentesting-1-4.png)

**Target IP Address:** 192.168.100.8

Now I have the target's IP address! High fives all around!

## Charting the Course: Scanning the Target Machine for Open Ports

With my target in sight, it's time to gather some intel. I'll use a powerful tool called ``nmap`` to scan the target machine and identify any open ports. These ports act like doorways into the system, and I'll be looking for any that might be vulnerable.

{{< highlight bash >}}

kali@kali:~$ nmap -p- -A 192.168.100.8

{{< /highlight >}}

![Vulnhub](/images/vulnhub-basic-pentesting-1-5.jpg)

The scan might reveal something like this:

| Port | Service | Version              |
| ---- | ------- | -------------------- |
| 21   | FTP     | ProFTPD 1.3.3c       |
| 22   | SSH     | OpenSSH 7.2p2 Ubuntu |
| 80   | HTTP    | Apache httpd 2.4.18  |

This information is like a treasure map, guiding me towards potential weaknesses!

## Setting Sail: Investigating the Web Server (Port 80)

My scan revealed an open port 80, which usually indicates a web server. Let's set my sights on this port and see what I can find.

<!-- Here's where things get interesting: -->

I visit the target's IP address in my browser, but the website doesn't reveal much.

![Vulnhub](/images/vulnhub-basic-pentesting-1-6.png)

I check the page source and **robots.txt** file (a file that tells search engines which parts of the website to crawl) for any hidden clues, but come up empty-handed.

![Vulnhub](/images/vulnhub-basic-pentesting-1-7.png)

**Hold on, don't despair! This is just the beginning.**

## Unmasking the Hidden: Discovering Hidden Directories with dirb

Since the website itself isn't giving anything away, I'll use a tool called ``dirb``. Think of it as a metal detector that helps me unearth hidden directories and files on the website.

>dirb scans the website and reveals some intriguing URLs that warrant further investigation.

{{< highlight bash >}}

kali@kali:~$ dirb http://192.168.100.8 /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -o dirb.txt

{{< /highlight >}}

![Vulnhub](/images/vulnhub-basic-pentesting-1-8.png)

## Following the Breadcrumbs: Exploring a Suspicious URL

One of the URLs dirb found leads me to a path called "secret." Sounds promising, right? I navigate to this path, but the page seems broken and the links don't work.

![Vulnhub](/images/vulnhub-basic-pentesting-1-9.png)

![Vulnhub](/images/vulnhub-basic-pentesting-1-10.jpg)

Upon closer inspection, I notice that the links use a domain name ("**vtcsec**") instead of the IP address. This is a small hurdle, but I can fix it!

## Mapping the Territory: Modifying the Hosts File

To make those links work properly, I need to create a little map. I'll edit a file called "hosts" on my machine, which tells my computer how to translate domain names into IP addresses.

{{< highlight bash >}}

kali@kali:~$ sudo nano /etc/hosts

{{< /highlight >}}

![Vulnhub](/images/vulnhub-basic-pentesting-1-11.png)

In this file, I'll add a new line that associates the domain name "**vtcsec**" with the target machine's IP address.

![Vulnhub](/images/vulnhub-basic-pentesting-1-12.png)

Now, when I try those links again, they should work like a charm!

## A Familiar Face: The Login Page Revelation

After fixing the domain issue, the "secret" page finally displays properly. But here's the twist: it leads me to a familiar sight – a WordPress login panel!

![Vulnhub](/images/vulnhub-basic-pentesting-1-13.jpg)

![Vulnhub](/images/vulnhub-basic-pentesting-1-14.png)

This is a golden opportunity! WordPress can sometimes be vulnerable, and I can use a tool called ``WPScan`` to exploit those vulnerabilities.

## Delving Deeper: Exploring User Enumeration and Password Cracking

With WPScan in hand, I'll conduct user enumeration to uncover potential usernames on the WordPress login panel. This step is crucial as it helps me identify accounts I can potentially exploit.

I'll fire up WPScan with the following command:

{{< highlight bash >}}

kali@kali:~$ wpscan --url https://192.168.100.8/secret/ enumerate -u

{{< /highlight >}}

![Vulnhub](/images/vulnhub-basic-pentesting-1-15.png)

![Vulnhub](/images/vulnhub-basic-pentesting-1-16.png)

This command instructs WPScan to enumerate usernames on the specified URL. I'll keep my eyes peeled for any usernames that might come up! Using WPScan, I might be able to find a username like "**admin**".

## Breaking In: Attempting Password Cracking

Now that I have some potential usernames, it's time to crack some passwords! I'll use WPScan again, this time with a wordlist to brute-force my way into the system.

Here's the command I'll use:

{{< highlight bash >}}

kali@kali:~$ wpscan --url http://vtcsec/secret/ --username admin --passwords /path/to/wordlist.txt --force

{{< /highlight >}}

![Vulnhub](/images/vulnhub-basic-pentesting-1-17.png)

![Vulnhub](/images/vulnhub-basic-pentesting-1-18.png)

I'll replace "/path/to/wordlist.txt" with the path to my chosen wordlist. WPScan will then attempt to crack the password for the "admin" user.

## Victory Lap: Gaining Access to the WordPress Panel

![Vulnhub](/images/vulnhub-basic-pentesting-1-19.png)

**Success!** I've managed to breach the WordPress login panel using the credentials I uncovered. Now, I'm inside the system, ready to explore and exploit further.

**But wait, there's more!**

## Exploiting Vulnerabilities: Injecting a Malicious PHP Script

Now that I have access to the WordPress panel, it's time to take things up a notch. I'll inject a malicious PHP script to establish a reverse shell connection from the target machine to my attacker machine.

I'll use a popular PHP reverse shell script, such as the one found at [GitHub](https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/blob/master/php-reverse-shell.php).

![Vulnhub](/images/vulnhub-basic-pentesting-1-20.png)

## Manipulating the Code: Injecting the PHP Script

I'll head over to the Appearance section in the WordPress panel and select the Editor. From there, I'll navigate to the Theme Header (header.php) file.

![Vulnhub](/images/vulnhub-basic-pentesting-1-21.png)

I'll delete any existing code in the file and replace it with the malicious PHP script code I obtained earlier. Don't forget to update the IP address to your attacker machine's IP and choose a port that isn't in use.

Save the changes, and now the trap is set!

## Reaping the Rewards: Establishing a Reverse Shell Connection

With the malicious PHP script in place, all that's left to do is wait. I'll fire up netcat on my attacker machine to listen for incoming connections:

{{< highlight bash >}}

kali@kali:~$ nc -lvnp <chosen_port>

{{< /highlight >}}

![Vulnhub](/images/vulnhub-basic-pentesting-1-22.png)

Now, I'll simply revisit the target URL where I injected the script, and voila! I'll receive a connection on my netcat listener, confirming that I've successfully established a reverse shell connection.

And there you have it – from reconnaissance to exploitation, I've conquered Vulnhub's Basic Pentesting 1 like a true penetration testing pro!
