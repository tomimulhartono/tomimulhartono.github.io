Hey, tech enthusiasts! Today, I want to share an exciting chapter in my development journey: working on the **SITERPADU** application. This project, which spanned all of 2022, was an incredible opportunity to dive deep into the world of full-stack development while creating something that truly makes a difference in academic administration.

## What’s SITERPADU All About?

SITERPADU (short for *Sistem Terintegrasi Pengelolaan Sumber Daya Universitas Jenderal Achmad Yani*) is an online platform designed to simplify and streamline administrative processes for the university. Built with **PHP 5.6** and an **Oracle database**, it features a wide range of modules, including:

- New Student Admissions (PMB)
- Lecture Scheduling
- Lecturer and Student Data Management

My focus? Crafting the **Graduation Module**, which helps students navigate their graduation process smoothly and efficiently.

## A Closer Look at the Graduation Module

This module handles everything related to graduation, from registration to certificate issuance. Here's what it does:

- **Registration:** Students can sign up for graduation by uploading required documents and completing necessary steps.
- **Financial Procedures:** Ensures students settle tuition fees and any other financial obligations before graduating.
- **Certificate Issuance:** Automates certificate generation for students who meet all requirement

## Overcoming Challenges

Jumping into an ongoing project was no small feat! I had to quickly familiarize myself with the existing codebase and align with the team's development approach. Adapting to their style while contributing something meaningful taught me a lot about teamwork and problem-solving.

**Biggest Lesson?** Challenges are just opportunities to level up your skills. Dive in, stay curious, and don’t back down.

## Key Takeaways

Here are some highlights from this experience:

1. **Team Collaboration:** Building something great always takes a team. Learning from others while sharing your knowledge is priceless.
2. **Adaptability:** Every project is different. Being flexible with new tools and workflows makes you a stronger developer.
3. **Attention to Detail:** Especially in something like academic administration, precision is key. Mistakes can ripple into bigger issues, so double-checking your work matters.
