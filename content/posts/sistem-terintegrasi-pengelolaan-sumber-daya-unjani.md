Greetings, fellow tech enthusiasts! Today, I'm thrilled to share my journey as a Full Stack Developer at Bandung Techno Park, where I had the privilege of contributing to the development of the **SITERPADU** application. This project, spanning from **January 1, 2022, to December 31, 2022**, provided me with invaluable hands-on experience and a deeper understanding of the intricacies of full-stack development.

## What’s SITERPADU All About?

SITERPADU stands as a testament to the power of technology in streamlining academic administration. Built using **PHP 5.6** and **Oracle database**, this integrated online system caters to the needs of Universitas Jenderal Achmad Yani. Its comprehensive suite of modules encompasses:

- New Student Admission (PMB)
- Lecture Scheduling
- Data Management for Both Lecturers and Students

## My Role: The Graduation Module

While the overall development of SITERPADU was a collaborative effort, I took on a pivotal role in crafting the Graduation Module. This module ensures a seamless administrative process for student graduation, encompassing:

- **Registration:** Students sign up for graduation by submitting their documents and following the required steps.
- **Financial Procedures:** Ensuring all tuition fees and financial obligations are settled before students graduate.
- **Certificate Issuance:** Students receive their certificates once they’ve met all the requirements.

## Facing the Challenge

Stepping into an ongoing project presented its own set of challenges. Familiarizing myself with the existing codebase and aligning my development style with the team's approach required meticulous effort. However, this challenge proved to be a valuable learning experience, honing my adaptability and problem-solving skills.

>**Key Takeaway:** "Embrace challenges as opportunities for growth. They are the stepping stones to mastery."

## Sneak Peeks

To better illustrate the Graduation Module's capabilities, let's delve into a table summarizing its key functionalities:

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Registration | Students register for graduation by submitting the required documents and completing necessary procedures. |
| Financial Procedures | Students clear all outstanding tuition fees and other financial obligations before graduation. |
| Certificate Issuance | Upon successful completion of all requirements, students receive their graduation certificates. |

## Wrap-Up

My involvement in the SITERPADU project has been a rewarding journey, allowing me to hone my full-stack development skills and gain insights into the intricacies of project management and collaboration. I am grateful for the opportunity to have contributed to a project that positively impacts the academic experience of countless students.

>**Final Thought:** "Full-stack development is a multifaceted adventure, demanding expertise in both front-end and back-end technologies. It's a field that constantly evolves, keeping you on your toes and eager to learn."

I hope this blog post has provided you with a glimpse into my full-stack development journey at Bandung Techno Park.
