Certificates are digital files that help ensure secure communication between a user's computer and a website, server, or network service. They verify that a connection is legitimate and encrypted, preventing unauthorized access and data interception.

In your case, since you're developing a proxy for web filtering, installing certificates is an essential first step. This allows your proxy to inspect encrypted traffic without triggering security warnings in browsers or applications. The installation process varies depending on your specific needs, but the steps below will guide you through setting up certificates on both Windows and macOS.

## Setting Up Certificates on Windows

Setting up a certificate on Windows ensures your system recognizes and trusts the certificate authority (CA), preventing security warnings when accessing filtered web content through your proxy. Follow the steps below to install a trusted root certificate.

### Installing a Trusted Root Certificate

Before proceeding, decide whether you want to install the certificate for just your user account or for the entire machine. If you're testing or using the proxy only for yourself, installing it under **Current User** is sufficient. However, if you need system-wide filtering, install it under **Local Machine**.

#### Step 1: Current User

This method installs the certificate only for the logged-in user. If you're testing or developing, this is the quickest way to get started.

1. **Double-click** the certificate file.

2. If the Open File - Security Warning dialog appears, click **Open**.

3. When the Certificate Wizard opens, click **Install Certificate…**.

4. In the Certificate Import Wizard, ensure that **Store Location** is set to **Current User**.

5. On the Certificate Store page, select **Place all certificates in the following store**, then click **Browse…**.

6. Choose **Trusted Root Certification Authorities** and click **OK**.

7. Confirm the selected Certificate Store is correct, then click **Next**.

8. On the Completing the Certificate Import Wizard page, click **Finish**.

9. If a Security Warning popup appears, click **Yes**.

10. The certificate import is now complete. Click **OK** to close any remaining popups.

#### Step 2: Install for Local Machine

If you need the certificate to be trusted system-wide for all users, follow these steps. **Admin access is required**.

1. **Double-click** the certificate file.

2. If the Open File - Security Warning dialog appears, click **Open**.

    ![Screenshot](/images/cert-12.png)

3. When the Certificate Wizard opens, click **Install Certificate…**.

    ![Screenshot](/images/cert-13.png)

4. In the Certificate Import Wizard, ensure that **Store Location** is set to **Local Machine**.

    ![Screenshot](/images/cert-14.png)

5. If prompted for a password, enter the **Administrator password**.

    ![Screenshot](/images/cert-15.png)

6. On the Certificate Store page, select **Place all certificates in the following store**, then click **Browse…**.

    ![Screenshot](/images/cert-16.png)

7. Choose **Trusted Root Certification Authorities** and click **OK**.

    ![Screenshot](/images/cert-17.png)

8. Confirm the selected Certificate Store is correct, then click **Next**.

    ![Screenshot](/images/cert-18.png)

9. On the Completing the Certificate Import Wizard page, click **Finish**.

    ![Screenshot](/images/cert-19.png)

10. The certificate import is now complete. Click **OK** to close any remaining popups.

### Verifying Installed Certificates Using Snap-ins

After installation, it's always a good idea to verify that the certificate is correctly installed. This ensures that your proxy can operate smoothly without running into trust issues.

1. Open the **Start Menu**, type **mmc**, and select **Run as Administrator**.

2. If prompted for a password, enter the **Administrator password**.

3. When the Console1 dialog opens, click **File**, then select **Add/Remove Snap-in**.

    ![Screenshot](/images/cert-23.png)

4. In the Add or Remove Snap-ins dialog, select **Certificates** from the Available Snap-ins list and click **Add**.

    ![Screenshot](/images/cert-24.png)

5. In the Certificates Snap-in dialog, choose **My user account** and click **Finish**.

    ![Screenshot](/images/cert-25.png)

6. Repeat the process by selecting **Certificates** again from the Available Snap-ins list and clicking **Add**.

    ![Screenshot](/images/cert-26.png)

7. In the Certificates Snap-in dialog, select **Computer account** and click **Next**.

    ![Screenshot](/images/cert-27.png)

8. In the Select Computer dialog, choose **Local computer** and click **Finish**.

    ![Screenshot](/images/cert-28.png)

9. Ensure the Selected Snap-ins list includes both **Certificates - Current User** and **Certificates - (Local Computer)**. Click **OK**.

    ![Screenshot](/images/cert-29.png)

10. Verify that the certificate is installed by expanding:
    - **Certificates - Current User** → **Trusted Root Certification Authorities** → **Certificates**, then **scroll** through the list to ensure the certificate is present.
    -  **Certificates - (Local Computer)** → **Trusted Root Certification Authorities** → **Certificates**, and ensure the same certificate is listed.

11. Once verified, **close** the Console1 dialog. If prompted to save the console, click **Yes**, and **save** it with an appropriate name.
