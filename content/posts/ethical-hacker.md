**Welcome to my blog!** The digital world is rapidly evolving, opening up new opportunities while also presenting increasingly complex cybersecurity risks. On March 29, 2024, I completed the Ethical Hacker course from Cisco Networking Academy, a significant step in my journey to becoming a hero in this challenging digital landscape.

## What is Ethical Hacking?

Ethical hacking is the practice of learning and applying hacking techniques used by malicious hackers, but with the noble purpose of finding and fixing system vulnerabilities. Ethical hackers act as the frontline in combating cybercrime by helping organizations and individuals improve their cybersecurity.

## What Did I Learn from the Ethical Hacker Course?

The Ethical Hacker course from Cisco Networking Academy equipped me with various essential knowledge and skills, such as:

- **Understanding and applying hacking techniques:** I learned about various hacking techniques used by malicious hackers, from social engineering to exploiting vulnerabilities in applications and networks.
- **Conducting penetration testing:** I learned how to simulate cyber attacks to find and fix vulnerabilities in systems.
- **Using pentesting tools:** I was trained to use various sophisticated tools for conducting penetration testing and vulnerability analysis.
- **Creating comprehensive reports:** I learned how to create easy-to-understand reports on penetration testing results, which can help organizations take appropriate mitigation steps.

## Why Am I Interested in Ethical Hacking?

Since childhood, I have always been fascinated by technology and the digital world. As technology has evolved, I have become increasingly aware of the importance of cybersecurity. I want to be part of the solution in combating cybercrime, and ethical hacking gives me the opportunity to use my knowledge and skills to make the digital world a safer place.

## What Will I Do Next?

The Ethical Hacker course is just the beginning of my journey. I want to continue learning and developing my skills in cybersecurity. I want to use my knowledge and skills to help organizations and individuals improve their cybersecurity and contribute to creating a safer and more trusted digital world for everyone.

**Here are some tables showing some of the skills I gained from the Ethical Hacker course:**

| Skill | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Ethical Hacking | Understanding and applying hacking techniques used by malicious hackers, but with the aim of finding and fixing system vulnerabilities. |
| Exploiting Applications | Finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications and software. |
| Exploiting Networks | Understanding and exploiting vulnerabilities in computer networks. |
| IoT Security | Understanding and securing Internet of Things (IoT) devices from various threats. |

I am very grateful for the opportunity to take the Ethical Hacker course from Cisco Networking Academy. This course has given me a lot of valuable knowledge and skills in cybersecurity. I hope this blog can help others to better understand ethical hacking and the importance of cybersecurity.
